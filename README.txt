Run main.py to see either:
1) Test cases for both WikipediaCorpusReader and WikipediaTopicAnalyzer or
2) Run an interactive session with the WikipediaCorpusReader (limited
	functionality)
	
Note that there is no corpus in this folder because it hasn't been 
generated yet. Once it is generated, it will stay in the folder. To
see how the corpus is dynamically generated, run the interactive session.
