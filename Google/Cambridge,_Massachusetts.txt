medicinal propertie [ citation needed ] The first houses were built in the spring of 163 The settlement was initially referred to as the newe towne Official Massachusetts records show the name capitalized as Newe Towne by 163 Located at the first convenient Charles River crossing west of Boston Newe Towne was one of a number of towns including Boston Dorchester Watertown and Weymouth founded by the 700 original Puritan colonists of the Massachusetts Bay Colony under governor John Winthrop The original village site is in the heart of today s Harvard Square The marketplace where farmers brought in crops from surrounding towns to sell survives today as the small park at the corner of John Kennedy J.F. and Winthrop Streets then at the edge of a salt marsh since fille The town included a much larger area than the present city with various outlying parts becoming independent towns over the years Newton originally Cambridge Village then Newtown in 1688 Lexington Cambridge Farms in 1712 and both West Cambridge originally Menotomy and Brighton Little Cambridge in 180 Part of West Cambridge joined the new town of Belmont in 1859 and the rest of West Cambridge was renamed Arlington in 1867 Brighton was annexed by Boston in 187 In the late 19th century various schemes for annexing Cambridge itself to the City of Boston were pursued and rejecte In 1636 Harvard College was founded by the colony to train ministers and the new town was chosen for its site by Thomas Dudley By 1638 the name Newe Towne had compacted by usage into Newtowne In May 1638 the name was changed to Cambridge in honor of the university in Cambridge England The first president Henry Dunster the first benefactor John Harvard and the first schoolmaster Nathaniel Eaton of Harvard were all Cambridge University alumni as was the then ruling and first governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony John Winthro In 1629 Winthrop had led the signing of the founding document of the city of Boston which was known as the Cambridge Agreement after the universit It was Governor Thomas Dudley who in 1650 signed the charter creating the corporation which still governs Harvard Colleg George Washington in Cambridge 1775 Cambridge grew slowly as an agricultural village eight miles 13km by road from Boston the capital of the colon By the American Revolution most residents lived near the Common and Harvard College with farms and estates comprising most of the tow Most of the inhabitants were descendants of the original Puritan colonists but there was also a small elite of Anglican worthies who were not involved in village life who made their livings from estates investments and trade and lived in mansions along the Road to Watertown today s Brattle Street still known as Tory Row In 1775 George Washington came up from Virginia to take command of fledgling volunteer American soldiers camped on the Cambridge Common today called the birthplace of the U. Army The name of today s nearby Sheraton Commander Hotel refers to that even Most of the Tory estates were confiscated after the Revolutio On January 24 1776 Henry Knox arrived with artillery captured from Fort Ticonderoga which enabled Washington to drive the British army out of Bosto A map of Cambridge from 1873 Between 1790 and 1840 Cambridge began to grow rapidly with the construction of the West Boston Bridge in 1792 that connected Cambridge directly to Boston making it no longer necessary to travel eight miles 13km through the Boston Neck Roxbury and Brookline to cross the Charles River A second bridge the Canal Bridge opened in 1809 alongside the new Middlesex Canal The new bridges and roads made what were formerly estates and marshland into prime industrial and residential district In the mid-19th century Cambridge was the center of a literary revolution when it gave the country a new identity through poetry and literatur Cambridge was home to the famous Fireside Poetsso called because their poems would often be read aloud by families in front of their evening fire In their day the Fireside Poets Henry Wadsworth Longfellow James Russell Lowell and Oliver Wendell Holmes were as popular and influential as rock stars are toda [ citation needed ] Soon after turnpikes were built the Cambridge and Concord Turnpike today s Broadway and Concord Av the Middlesex Turnpike Hampshire S and Massachusetts Av northwest of Porter Square and what are today s Cambridge Main and Harvard Streets were roads to connect various areas of Cambridge to the bridge In addition railroads crisscrossed the town during the same era leading to the development of Porter Square as well as the creation of neighboring town Somerville from the formerly rural parts of Charlestown 1852 Map of Boston area showing Cambridge and rail line Cambridge was incorporated as a city in 184 This was despite noticeable tensions between East Cambridge Cambridgeport and Old Cambridge that stemmed from differences in in each area s culture sources of income and the national origins of the resident The city s commercial center began to shift from Harvard Square to Central Square which became the downtown of the city around this tim Between 1850 and 1900 Cambridge took on much of its present character streetcar suburban development along the turnpikes with working-class and industrial neighborhoods focused on East Cambridge comfortable middle-class housing being built on old estates in Cambridgeport and Mid-Cambridge and upper-class enclaves near Harvard University and on the minor hills of the cit The coming of the railroad to North Cambridge and Northwest Cambridge then led to three major changes in the city the development of massive brickyards and brickworks between Massachusetts Ave. Concord Av and Alewife Brook the ice-cutting industry launched by Frederic Tudor on Fresh Pond and the carving up of the last estates into residential subdivisions to provide housing to the thousands of immigrants that arrived to work in the new industrie For many years the city s largest employer was the New England Glass Company founded in 181 By the middle of the 19th century it was the largest and most modern glassworks in the worl In 1888 all production was moved by Edward Drummond Libbey to Toledo Ohio where it continues today under the name Owens Illinoi Flint glassware with heavy lead content produced by that company is prized by antique glass collector There is none on public display in Cambridge but there is a large collection in the Toledo Museum of Art Among the largest businesses located in Cambridge was the firm of Carter s Ink Company whose neon sign long adorned the Charles River and which was for many years the largest manufacturer of ink in the worl By 1920 Cambridge was one of the main industrial cities of New England with nearly 120,000 resident As industry in New England began to decline during the Great Depression and after World War II Cambridge lost much of its industrial bas It also began the transition to being an intellectual rather than an industrial cente Harvard University had always been important in the city both as a landowner and as an institution but it began to play a more dominant role in the city s life and cultur Also the move of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from Boston in 1916 ensured Cambridge s status as an intellectual center of the United State After the 1950s the city s population began to decline slowly as families tended to be replaced by single people and young couple The 1980s brought a wave of high-technology startups creating software such as Visicalc and Lotus 1-2-3 and advanced computers but many of these companies fell into decline with the fall of the minicomputer and DOS -based system However the city continues to be home to many startups as well as a thriving biotech industr By the end of the 20th century Cambridge had one of the most expensive housing markets in the Northeastern United State While maintaining much diversity in class race and age it became harder and harder for those who grew up in the city to be able to afford to sta The end of rent control in 1994 prompted many Cambridge renters to move to housing that was more affordable in Somerville and other communitie In 2005 a reassessment of residential property values resulted in a disproportionate number of houses owned by non-affluent people jumping in value relative to other houses with hundreds having their property tax increased by over 100% this forced many homeowners in Cambridge to move elsewher As of 2012 Cambridge s mix of amenities and proximity to Boston has kept housing prices relatively stabl Geography A view from Boston of Harvard s Weld Boathouse and
