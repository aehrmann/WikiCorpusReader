 Photovoltaic module redirects her For the heat collectors see Solar thermal collector An installation of 24 solar panels in rural Mongolia A solar panel or photovoltaic module is composed of individual PV cell This crystalline-silicon panel has an aluminium frame and glass on the fron Solar panels on the International Space Station a half-built homemade solar panel made from individual cells soldered together A solar panel also solar module photovoltaic module or photovoltaic panel is a packaged connected assembly of photovoltaic cells The solar panel can be used as a component of a larger photovoltaic system to generate and supply electricity in commercial and residential application Each panel is rated by its DC output power under standard test conditions and typically ranges from 100 to 320 watt The efficiency of a panel determines the area of a panel given the same rated output - an 8% efficient 230 watt panel will have twice the area of a 16% efficient 230 watt pane Because a single solar panel can produce only a limited amount of power most installations contain multiple panel A photovoltaic system typically includes an array of solar panels an inverter and sometimes a battery and or solar tracker and interconnection wirin 1 Theory and construction 2 Efficiencies 3 Crystalline silicon modules 4 Thin-film modules 4.1 Rigid thin-film modules 4.2 Flexible

in a solar pane Solar panels use light energy photons from the sun to generate electricity through the photovoltaic effect The majority of modules use wafer -based crystalline silicon cells or thin-film cells based on cadmium telluride or silicon The structural load carrying member of a module can either be the top layer or the back laye Cells must also be protected from mechanical damage and moistur Most solar panels are rigid but semi-flexible ones are available based on thin-film cell Electrical connections are made in series to achieve a desired output voltage and/or in parallel to provide a desired current capabilit The conducting wires that take the current off the panels may contain silver copper or other non-magnetic conductive transition metals The cells must be connected electrically to one another and to the rest of the syste Externally popular terrestrial usage photovoltaic panels use MC3 older or MC4 connectors to facilitate easy weatherproof connections to the rest of the syste Bypass diodes may be incorporated or used externally in case of partial panel shading to maximize the output of panel sections still illuminate The p-n junctions of mono-crystalline silicon cells may have adequate reverse voltage characteristics to prevent damaging panel section reverse curren Reverse currents could lead to overheating of shaded cell Solar cells become less efficient at higher temperatures and installers try to provide good ventilation behind solar panel Some recent solar panel designs include concentrators in which light is focused by lenses or mirrors onto an array of smaller cell This enables the use of cells with a high cost per unit area such as gallium arsenide in a cost-effective wa [ citation needed ] Efficiencies Depending on construction photovoltaic panels can produce electricity from a range of frequencies of light but usually cannot cover the entire solar range specifically ultraviolet infrared and low or diffused light Hence much of the incident sunlight energy is wasted by solar panels and they can give far higher efficiencies if illuminated with monochromatic ligh Therefore another design concept is to split the light into different wavelength ranges and direct the beams onto different cells tuned to those range This has been projected to be capable of raising efficiency by 50 Currently the best achieved sunlight conversion rate solar panel efficiency is around 21% in commercial products typically lower than the efficiencies of their cells in isolatio The energy density of a solar panel is the efficiency described in terms of peak power output per unit of surface area commonly expressed in units of watts per square foot W/ft 2 The most efficient mass-produced solar panels have energy density values of greater than 13 W/ft 2 140 W/m 2 Crystalline silicon modules Main article Solar cell Most solar modules are currently produced from silicon photovoltaic cells These are typically categorized as monocrystalline or polycrystalline module Thin-film modules Main articles Thin film solar cell Third generation solar cell and Low-cost photovoltaic cell Third generation solar cells are advanced thin-film cell They produce high-efficiency conversion at low cos Rigid thin-film modules In rigid thin film modules the cell and the module are manufactured in the same production lin The cell is created on a glass substrate or superstrate and the electrical connections are created in situ a so called monolithic integration The substrate or superstrate is laminated with an encapsulant to a front or back sheet usually another sheet of glas The main cell technologies in this category are CdTe or a-Si or a-Si+uc-Si tandem or CIGS or variant Amorphous silicon has a sunlight conversion rate of 6-12 Flexible thin-film modules Flexible thin film cells and modules are created on the same production line by depositing the photoactive layer and other necessary layers on a flexible substrate If the substrate is an insulator e. polyester or polyimide film then monolithic integration can be use If it is a conductor then another technique for electrical connection must be use The cells are assembled into modules by laminating them to a transparent colourless fluoropolymer on the front side typically ETFE or FEP and a polymer suitable for bonding to the final substrate on the other sid The only commercially available in MW quantities flexible module uses amorphous silicon triple junction from Unisolar So-called inverted metamorphic IMM multijunction solar cells made on compound-semiconductor technology are just becoming commercialized in July 200 The University of Michigan s solar car that won the North American Solar Challenge in July 2008 used IMM thin-film flexible solar cell The requirements for residential and commercial are different in that the residential needs are simple and can be packaged so that as solar cell technology progresses the other base line equipment such as the battery inverter and voltage sensing transfer switch still need to be compacted and unitized for residential us Commercial use depending on the size of the service will be limited in the photovoltaic cell arena and more complex parabolic reflectors and solar concentrators are becoming the dominant technolog The global flexible and thin-film photovoltaic PV market despite caution in the overall PV industry is expected to experience a CAGR of over 35% to 2019 surpassing 32 GW according to a major new study by IntertechPir Module embedded electronics See also Solar micro-inverter Several companies have begun embedding electronics into PV module This enables performing maximum power point tracking MPPT for each module individually and the measurement of performance data for monitoring and fault detection at module leve Some of these solutions make use of power optimizers a DC-to-DC converter technology developed to maximize the power harvest from solar photovoltaic system As of about 2010 such electronics can also compensate for shading effects wherein a shadow falling across a section of a panel causes the electrical output of one or more strings of cells in the panel to fall to zero but not having the output of the entire panel fall to zer Module performance and aging Module performance is generally rated under standard test conditions STC irradiance of 1,000 W/m solar spectrum of AM 1.5 and module temperature at 25 Electrical characteristics include nominal power P MAX measured in W open circuit voltage V OC short circuit current I SC measured in amperes maximum power voltage V MPP maximum power current I MPP peak power W p and module efficiency % Nominal voltage refers to the voltage of the battery that the module is best suited to charge this is a leftover term from the days when solar panels were only used to charge batterie The actual voltage output of the panel changes as lighting temperature and load conditions change so there is never one specific voltage at which the panel operate Nominal voltage allows users at a glance to make sure the panel is compatible with a given syste Open circuit voltage or V OC is the maximum voltage that the panel can produce when not connected to an electrical circuit or syste V OC can be measured with a meter directly on an illuminated panel s terminals or on its disconnected cabl The peak power rating W p is the maximum output according under standard test conditions not the maximum possible output Typical panels which could measure approximately 1x2 meters or 2x4 feet will be rated from as low as 75 Watts to as high as 350 Watts depending on their efficienc At test panels are binned by their test results and a typical manufacturer might rate their panels in 5 Watt increments and either rate them at +/- 3% +/-5% +3/-0% or +5/-0 Solar panels must withstand rain hail and cycles of heat and cold for many year Many crystalline silicon module manufacturers offer a warranty that guarantees electrical production for 10 years at 90% of rated power output and 25 years at 80 The output power of many panels slowly degrades at about 0.5%/yea Recycling Most parts of a solar module can be recycled including up to 95% of certain semiconductor materials or the glass as well as large amounts of ferrous and non-ferrous metal Some private companies and non-profit organisations are currently engaged in take-back and recycling operations for end-of-life module Recycling possibilities depend on the kind of technology used in the modules Silicon based modules aluminium frames and junction boxes are dismantled manually at the beginning of the proces The module is then crushed in a mill and the different fractions are separated - glass plastics and metal It is possible to recover more than 80% of the incoming weigh This process can be performed by flat glass recyclers since morphology and composition of a PV module is similar to those flat glasses used in the building and automotive industr The recovered glass for example is readily accepted by the glass foam and glass insulation industr Non-silicon based modules they require specific recycling technologies such as the use of chemical baths in order to separate the different semiconductor material For cadmium telluride panels the recycling process begins by crushing the module and subsequently separating the different fraction This recycling process is designed to recover up to 90% of the glass and 95% of the semiconductor materials containe Some commercial-scale recycling facilities have been created in recent years by private companie Production The solar tree a symbol of Gleisdorf Austria In 2010 15.9 GW of solar PV system installations were completed with solar PV pricing survey and market research company PVinsights reporting growth of 117.8% in solar PV installation on a year-on-year basi With over 100% year-on-year growth in PV system installation

Grid parity Average pricing information divides in three pricing categories those buying small quantities modules of all sizes in the kilowatt range annually mid-range buyers typically up to 10 MWp annually and large quantity buyers self-explanatoryand with access to the lowest prices Over the long termand only in the long-termthere is clearly a systematic reduction in the price of cells and module For example in 1998 it was estimated that the quantity cost per watt was about $4.50 which was 33 times lower than the cost in 1970 of $15 In the real world prices depend a great deal on local weather condition In a cloudy country such as the United Kingdom price per installed kW is higher than in sunnier countries like Spai Following to RMI Balance-of-System BoS elements this is non-module cost of non- microinverter solar panels as wiring converters racking systems and various components make up about half of the total costs of installation Also standardizing technologies could encourage greater adoption of solar panels and in turn economies of scale [ citation needed ] Despite the cost of solar panels one of the main selling points of them is their return on investment which can be as high as 6.8% in some areas of the United Kingdom where a typical 4 kWp panel would take about 15 years to be paid of [ citation needed ] Mounting systems This section needs additional
