Office 2.0 The term Office 2.0 which is sometimes used to refer to online office suites originated with Ismael Ghalimi in an experimental effort to test whether he could perform all of his computer based work in online application It is a marketing neologism representing the concepts of office productivity applications as published applications rather than stand-alone programs leveraging the Web 2.0 concept to conjure imagery of collaborative community based and centralised effort rather than the more traditional application running on a platform locall It is also the focus of the annual Office 2.0 Conference Examples Examples of where the term may apply include The centralized administration of office productivity software installation licensing and version control Collaborative applications which improve personal and organizational productivity Centralized storage of data rather than traditional personal data responsibility Applications which focus on collaborative data sharing document review and document resource management Office applications which are able to be run from multiple independent platforms with a suitable back-end framework to present the application in a uniform manne The Google Docs online applications gives a good outline of some of these capabilitie Advantages The cost is lo In most cases there is no specific charge for using the service for users who already have access to a computer with a web browser and a connection to the Interne There is no need to download or install software outside of the office suite s web page including the ongoing upgrade chores of adding new features to or eliminating bugs from the office suit Online office suites can run on thin clients with minimal hardware requirement Online office suites provide the ability for a group of people to share a document without the need to run their own serve There is no need to purchase or upgrade a software license Instead the online office suite is available as software as a service Online office suites are portable Users can access their documents from almost any computer with a connection to the Internet regardless of which operating system they us If the user s computer fails the documents are still safely stored on the remote serve Online service providers backup processes and overall stability will generally be superior to that of most home system Disadvantages Access requires connectivity--if the remote server or network is unavailable the content will also be unavailabl However in many cases the online suite will allow the user to regularly backup data or even provide synchronization of documents between the server and the local compute There are speed and accessibility issue Most of the available online office suites require a high speed broadband Internet connectio That can be a problem for users who are limited by a slower connection to the Interne The number of features available is an issu Online office suites lack the more advanced features available on their offline counterpart There may be a subscription charge to use the servic In that case in the long run the ongoing subscription cost may be more expensive than purchasing offline software upfron The user has no control over the version of the software use If the software is changed the user is forced to use the changed version even if the changed version is less suited to the use The user is reliant on the service provider for security and privacy of their document Criticism As with most marketing neologisms which later become accepted public trends technologists contend that these technologies have existed for some time particularly in the form of Microsoft Terminal Services based applications and Citrix XenApp published application framework The term itself is likely to only be used as a reference to a group of selling point There are also questions as to how businesses will be affected by storing all of their documents in online environment For example the search and seizures provisions offered by the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution do not apply to online service providers storing third-party data see NSA
