The very first tool used for searching on the Internet was Archie The name stands for archive without the v It was created in 1990 by Alan Emtage Bill Heelan and Peter Deutsch computer science students at McGill University in Montreal The program downloaded the directory listings of all the files located on public anonymous FTP File Transfer Protocol sites creating a searchable database of file names however Archie did not index the contents of these sites since the amount of data was so limited it could be readily searched manuall The rise of Gopher created in 1991 by Mark McCahill at the University of Minnesota led to two new search programs Veronica and Jughead Like Archie they searched the file names and titles stored in Gopher index system Veronica V ery E asy R odent- O riented N et-wide I ndex to C omputerized A rchives provided a keyword search of most Gopher menu titles in the entire Gopher listing Jughead J onzy s U niversal G opher H ierarchy E xcavation A nd D isplay was a tool for obtaining menu information from specific Gopher server While the name of the search engine Archie was not a reference to the Archie comic book series Veronica and Jughead are characters in the series thus referencing their predecesso In the summer of 1993 no search engine existed yet for the web though numerous specialized catalogues were maintained by han Oscar Nierstrasz at the University of Geneva wrote a series of Perl scripts that would periodically mirror these pages and rewrite them into a standard format which formed the basis for W3Catalog the web s first primitive search engine released on September 2 199 In June 1993 Matthew Gray then at MIT produced what was probably the first web robot the Perl -based World Wide Web Wanderer and used it to generate an index called Wandex The purpose of the Wanderer was to measure the size of the World Wide Web which it did until late 199 The web s second search engine Aliweb appeared in November 199 Aliweb did not use a web robot but instead depended on being notified by website administrators of the existence at each site of an index file in a particular forma JumpStation released in December 1993 used a web robot to find web pages and to build its index and used a web form as the interface to its query progra It was thus the first WWW resource-discovery tool to combine the three essential features of a web search engine crawling indexing and searching as described belo Because of the limited resources available on the platform on which it ran its indexing and hence searching were limited to the titles and headings found in the web pages the crawler encountere One of the first all text crawler-based search engines was WebCrawler which came out in 199 Unlike its predecessors it let users search for any word in any webpage which has become the standard for all major search engines sinc It was also the first one to be widely known by the publi Also in 1994 Lycos which started at Carnegie Mellon University was launched and became a major commercial endeavo Soon after many search engines appeared and vied for popularit These included Magellan Excite Infoseek Inktomi Northern Light and AltaVista Yahoo! was among the most popular ways for people to find web pages of interest but its search function operated on its web directory rather than full-text copies of web page Information seekers could also browse the directory instead of doing a keyword-based searc In 1996 Netscape was looking to give a single search engine an exclusive deal to be the featured search engine on Netscape s web browse There was so much interest that instead a deal was struck with Netscape by five of the major search engines where for $5 million per year each search engine would be in rotation on the Netscape search engine pag The five engines were Yahoo! Magellan Lycos Infoseek and Excit Search engines were also known as some of the brightest stars in the Internet investing frenzy that occurred in the late 1990 Several companies entered the market spectacularly receiving record gains during their initial public offerings Some have taken down their public search engine and are marketing enterprise-only editions such as Northern Ligh Many search engine companies were caught up in the dot-com bubble a speculation-driven market boom that peaked in 1999 and ended in 200 Around 2000 Google s search engine rose to prominenc The company achieved better results for many searches with an innovation called PageRank This iterative algorithm ranks web pages based on the number and PageRank of other web sites and pages that link there on the premise that good or desirable pages are linked to more than other Google also maintained a minimalist interface to its search engin In contrast many of its competitors embedded a search engine in a web portal By 2000 Yahoo! was providing search services based on Inktomi s search engin Yahoo! acquired Inktomi in 2002 and Overture which owned AlltheWeb and AltaVista in 200 Yahoo! switched to Google s search engine until 2004 when it launched its own search engine based on the combined technologies of its acquisition Microsoft first launched MSN Search in the fall of 1998 using search results from Inktom In early 1999 the site began to display listings from Looksmart blended with results from Inktomi except for a short time in 1999 when results from AltaVista were used instea In 2004 Microsoft began a transition to its own search technology powered by its own web crawler called msnbot Microsoft s rebranded search engine Bing was launched on June 1 200 On July 29 2009 Yahoo! and Microsoft finalized a deal in which Yahoo!
