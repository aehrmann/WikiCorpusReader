continued by his sons Edgar Alexander I and in particular David I David completed the division of the country into sheriffdoms by the conversion of existing thanedoms From the seventeenth century the shires started to be used for local administration apart from judicial function In 1667 Commissioners of Supply were appointed in each sheriffdom to collect the land ta The commissioners eventually assumed other duties in the count In 1858 police forces were established in each county under the Police Scotland Act 1857 As a result of the dual system of local government burghs of which there were

larger district councils and a distinction was made between large burghs i. those with a population of 20,000 or more and small burghs This system was further refined by the passing of the Local

widely in size some are the same as counties such as Clackmannanshire some are the same as former districts such as Inverclyde and some are the same as the former regions such as Highland The changes
