government as of the 5th May 2011 election Before the 2007 election Jack McConnell of the Labour Party was First Minister whose government was formed on a coalition basis with the Liberal Democrats Other parties represented in the parliament are the Conservative and Unionist Party and the Scottish Green Party Under devolution Scotland is represented by 59 MPs in the House of Commons of the United Kingdom elected from territory-based Scottish constituencies out of a total of 650 MPs in the House of Common A Secretary of State for Scotland who prior to devolution headed the system of government in Scotland sits in the Cabinet of the United Kingdom and is responsible for the limited number of powers the office retains since devolution as well as relations with other Whitehall Ministers who have power over reserved matters The Scottish Parliament can refer devolved matters back to Westminster to be considered as part of United Kingdom-wide legislation by passing a Legislative Consent Motion usually referred to as a Sewel Motio This has been done on a number of occasions where it has been seen as either more efficient or more politically expedient to have the legislation considered by Westminste The Scotland Office is a department of the United Kingdom government responsible for reserved Scottish affair The current Secretary of State for Scotland is Michael Moore MP a Liberal Democra Until 1999 Scottish peers were entitled to sit in the House of Lords The main political debate in Scotland tends to revolve around attitudes to the constitutional questio Under the pressure of growing support for Scottish independence a policy of devolution had been advocated by all three GB -wide parties to some degree during their history although Labour and the Conservatives have also at times opposed it This question dominated the Scottish political scene in the latter half of the 20th century with Labour leader John Smith describing the revival of a Scottish parliament as the settled will of the Scottish people Now that devolution has occurred the main argument about Scotland s constitutional status is over whether the Scottish Parliament should accrue additional powers for example over fiscal policy or seek to obtain full independence Ultimately the long term question is should the Scottish parliament continue to be a subsidiary assembly created and potentially abolished by the constitutionally dominant and sovereign parliament of the United Kingdom as in devolution or should it have an independent existence as of right with full sovereign powers either through independence a federal United Kingdom or a confederal arrangement ? To clarify these issues the SNP-led Scottish Executive published Choosing Scotland s Future a consultation document directed to the electorate under the National Conversation exercis The programmes of legislation enacted by the Scottish Parliament have seen the divergence in the provision of public services compared to the rest of the United Kingdo While the costs of a university education and care services for the elderly are free at point of use in Scotland fees are paid in the rest of the U Scotland was the first country in the UK to ban smoking in public place The Scottish Parliament The debating chamber of the Scottish Parliament Building Main article Scottish Parliament Although a similar measure had been rejected in 1979 the election of the Labour government in 1997 was followed by a referendum on establishing a devolved Scottish Parliament That September 74.3% voters agreed with the establishment of the parliament and 63.5% agreed it should be able to adjust income taxes by up to 3 The Parliament was then created by the Scotland Act 1998 of the Parliament of the United Kingdom Westminster Parliament This act sets out the subjects still dealt at Westminster referred to as reserved matters including Defence International Relations Fiscal and Economic Policy Drugs Law and Broadcastin Anything not mentioned as a specific reserved matter is automatically devolved to Scotland including health education local government Scots law and all other issue This is one of the key differences between the successful Scotland Act 1998 and the failed Scotland Act 1978 The Parliament is elected with a mixture of the first past the post system and a democratic proportional representation electoral system namely the additional members system Thus the Parliament is unlike the Westminster Parliament which is still elected solely by the first past the post metho The Scottish Parliament is elected every four years and contains 129 members referred to as Members of the Scottish Parliament MSPs Of the 129 MSPs 73 are elected to represent first past the post constituencies whilst the remaining 56 are elected by the additional member syste The proportional representation system has resulted in the election of a number of candidates from parties that would not have been expected to get representation through the first past the post syste To replace the Scottish Office a devolved government called the Scottish Executive latterly to be known as The Scottish Government was established with the First Minister of Scotland at its hea The secretariat of the Executive is part of the UK Civil Service and the head of the Executive the Permanent Secretary presently Sir Peter Housden is the equivalent of the Permanent Secretary of a Whitehall departmen

election upon Scottish seats Until the 2005 general election Scotland elected 72 MPs from 72 single-member constituencies to serve in the House of Commons As this over-represented Scotland in relation to the other components of the UK Clause 81 of the Scotland Act 1998 equalised the English and Scottish electoral quot As a result the Boundary Commission for Scotland s recommendations were adopted reducing Scottish representation in the House of Commons to 59 MPs from the 2005 general electio In order to facilitate this reduction in the number of MPs from Scottish constituencies the necessary amendment to the Scotland Act 1998 was passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom as the Scottish Parliament Constituencies Act 2004 The previous over-representation was widely accepted before to allow for a greater Scottish voice in the Commons but since the establishment of a Scottish Parliament it has been felt that this is not necessar Scottish MPs are elected at the same time as the rest of the UK s MP Scotland was historically represented in the UK government by the Secretary of State for Scotland This post was established in the 1880s but recently it has been the topic of much speculatio Many believe that since devolution there is no need for such a role to exis The current Secretary of State is Michael Moor His department the Scotland Office created in 1999 liaises with other Whitehall departments about devolution matter Current Scottish Representation in the Commons is Labour Party 41 Liberal Democrats 11 Scottish National Party 6 Conservative and Unionist Party 1 The House of Lords At one stage Scottish peers were entitled to elect sixteen representative peers to the House of Lords In 1963 the Peerage Act was passed allowing every Scottish peer to sit in the House of Lord However since the previous Labour government s reforms of that house this is no longer the case and hereditary Scottish peers have to stand for election from amongst all eligible peers

Parliament of Scotland and Treaty of Union 1707 Until 1832 Scottish politics remained very much in the control of landowners in the country and of small cliques of merchants in the burghs Agitation against this position through the Friends of the People Society in the 1790s met with Lord Braxfield s explicit repression on behalf of the landed interest The Scottish Reform Act 1832 rearranged the constituencies and increased the electorate from under 5,000 to 65,00 The Representation of the People Scotland Act 1868 extended the electorate to 232,000 but with residential qualifications peculiar to Scotland However by 1885 around 50% of the male population had the vote the secret ballot had become established and the modern political era had starte From 1885 to 1918 the Liberal Party almost totally dominated Scottish politic Only in the general election of 1955 did the Unionist Party together with their National Liberal and Liberal Unionist allies win a majority of vote In general the

contested a seat in 192 It merged with the centre-right Scottish Party in 1934 to form the Scottish National Party but the SNP remained a peripheral force until the watershed Hamilton by-election of 196 The Communists won West Fife in 1935 and again in 1945 Willie Gallacher and several Glasgow Labour MPs joined the Independent Labour Party in the 1930s often heavily defeating the official Labour candidate The National Government won the vast majority of Scottish seats in 1931 and 1935 the Liberal Party banished to the Highlands and Islands no longer functioned as a significant force in central Scotland In 1945 the SNP saw its first MP Robert McIntyre elected at the Motherwell by-election but had little success during the following decad The ILP members rejoined the Labour Party and Scotland now had in effect a two-party syste 1950 The Liberals won 2 seats - Jo Grimond winning Orkney and Shetland 1951 Labour and the Unionists won 35 seats each the Liberals losing one sea 1955 The Unionists won a majority of both seats and vote The SNP managed to finish second in Perth and Kinross 1959 In contrast to England Scotland swung to Labour which scored 4 gains at the expense of the

22% and then 30 With the Labour Party winning the latter election by a narrow margin the SNP appeared in a strong positio 1974-1979 Devolution dominated this period the Labour government attempted to steer through devolution legislation based on the recommendations of the Kilbrandon Commission against strong opposition not least from its own backbencher Finally a referendum whilst producing a small majority in favour of an elected Scottish Assembly failed to reach 40% of the total electorate a target set in the legislatio In the 1979 general election the SNP fared poorly falling to 17% of

by-election for the SN 1992 This election proved a disappointment for Labour and the SNP in Scotlan The SNP went from 14% to 21% of the vote but won only 3 seat The Conservative and Unionist vote did
