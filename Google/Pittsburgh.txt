and year-round particle pollution and the 20th worst ozone smog pollution results that have been disputed by governmen The ALA gave Allegheny County an F grade for both high ozone days and high particle pollution days in the period of 2007200 Although the county was still below the pass threshold the report demonstrated substantial improvement compared to previous decades on every measure of air qualit For example there were more than 40 high ozone days reported between 1997 and 1999 a figure which fell to fewer than 15 between 2007 and 2009 and just 10 between 2008 and 201 The Allegheny

third-most polluted metropolitan area behind Los Angeles and Bakersfield C This ranking was disputed by the Allegheny County Health Department since data from only one of Pittsburgh s 20 air quality monitors was considered by the ALA without any context or averagin Furthermore the monitor used is located immediately downwind and adjacent to U.

Historically Pittsburgh has been grouped in the rust belt however reflective of the rebound of the region within the last generation the metro area has come to be associated with the newly rebranded

Megalopolis This is despite the fact that the city is about 120 miles 190km from Lake Erie Pittsburgh s association with the Great Lakes region is due in part to its economic demographic and commuter

that southwestern Pennsylvania is far more interconnected with northeastern Ohio than it is with the eastern half of Pennsylvania and that the industries of Pittsburgh are primarily linked to Ohioan cities such as Youngstown Akron and Cleveland not to Pennsylvanian cities such as Allentown Scranton or Philadelphia He notes that conversely the population centers of northeastern Ohio are primarily connected with Pittsburgh and only secondarily connected to the state capital of Columbus Briem argues that In so many ways the state boundaries we think of as important are no more than lines on a ma
