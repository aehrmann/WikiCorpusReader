infringement against a user account will result in the account and all of its uploaded videos being delete Organizations including Viacom Mediaset and the English Premier League have filed lawsuits against YouTube claiming that it has done too little to prevent the uploading of copyrighted materia Viacom demanding $1 billion in damages said that it had found more than 150,000 unauthorized clips of its material on YouTube that had been viewed an astounding 1.5 billion times YouTube responded by stating that it goes far beyond its legal obligations in assisting content owners to protect their works During the same court battle Viacom won a court ruling requiring YouTube to hand over 12 terabytes of data detailing the viewing habits of every user who has watched videos on the sit The

The system was regarded by Google CEO Eric Schmidt as necessary for resolving lawsuits such as the one from Viacom which alleged that YouTube profited from pirated conten The system which became known as Content ID creates an ID File for copyrighted audio and video material and stores it in a databas When a video is uploaded it is checked against the database and flags the video as a copyright violation if a match is foun When this occurs the content owner has the choice of blocking the video to make it unviewable tracking the viewing statistics of the video or adding advertisements to the vide YouTube describes Content ID as very accurate in finding uploads that look similar to reference files that are of sufficient length and quality to generate an effective ID File Content ID accounts for over a third of the monetized views on YouTub An independent test in 2009 uploaded multiple versions of the same song to YouTube and concluded that while the system was surprisingly resilient in finding copyright violations in the audio tracks of videos it was not infallibl The use of Content ID to remove material automatically has led to controversy in some cases as the videos have not been checked by a human for fair use If a YouTube user disagrees with a decision by Content ID it is possible to fill in a form disputing the decisio YouTube has cited the effectiveness of

and have it dealt with promptl We educate our community on the rules and include a direct link from every YouTube page to make this process as easy as possible for our user Given the volume of content
