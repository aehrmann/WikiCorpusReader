others soon followed sui The OLPC project known for its innovation in producing a durable cost- and power-efficient netbook for developing countries is regarded as one of the major factors that led top computer hardware manufacturers to begin creating low-cost netbooks for the consumer marke When the first ASUS Eee PC sold over 300,000 units in four months companies such as Dell and Acer took note and began producing their own inexpensive netbook And while the OLPC XO-1 targets a different audience than do the other manufacturers netbooks it appears that OLPC is now facing competitio Developing countries now have a large choice of vendors from which they can choose which low-cost netbook they prefe Netbook market popularity within laptops in second half of 2008 based on the number of product clicks in the Laptop Subcategory per month by PriceGrabber By late 2008 netbooks had begun to take market share away from notebooks In contrast to earlier largely failed attempts to establish mini computers as a new class of mainstream personal computing devices built around comparatively expensive platforms requiring proprietary software applications or imposing severe usability limitations the recent success of netbooks can also be attributed to the fact that PC technology has now matured enough to allow truly cost optimized implementations with enough performance to suit the needs of a majority of PC user This is illustrated by the fact that typical system performance of a netbook is on the level of a mainstream PC in 2001 at around one quarter of the cos While this performance level suffices for most of the user needs it caused an increased interest in resource-efficient applications such as Google s Chrome and forced Microsoft to extend availability of Windows XP to secure market shar It is estimated that almost thirty times more netbooks were sold in 2008 11.4 million 70% of which were in Europe than in 2007 400,000 For 2009 sales are expected to jump to 35 million rising to an estimated 139 million in 201 This trend is reinforced by the rise of web-based applications as well as mobile networking and according to Wired Magazine netbooks are evolving into super-portable laptops for professionals The ongoing recession is also helping with the growing sales of netbook In Australia the New South Wales Department of Education and Training in partnership with Lenovo are providing Year 9 high school students in government high schools with free Lenovo S10e netbooks in 2009 Lenovo Mini 10 netbooks in 2010 Lenovo Edge 11 netbooks in 2011 and a modified Lenovo X130e netbook in 2012 each preloaded with software including Microsoft Office and Adobe Systems Creative Suite This is provided under Prime Minister Kevin Rudd s Digital Education Revolution or DE The netbooks run Windows 7 Enterpris These netbooks are secured with Computrace Lojack for laptops that the police can use to track the device if it is lost or stole The NSW DET retains ownership of these netbooks until the student graduates from Year 12 when the student can keep i The Government of Trinidad and Tobago-Prime Minister Kamla Persad Bisseser -

motherboard featuring the Intel Atom processor Netbooks typically have less powerful hardware than larger laptop computers and do not include an optical disc drive that larger laptops often hav Some netbooks do not even have a conventional hard drive Such netbooks use solid-state storage devices instead as these require less power are faster lighter and generally more shock-resistant but with much less storage capacity such as 32 64 or 128 GB compared to the 100 GB to 2 TB mechanical hard drives typical of many notebooks/laptop computers All netbooks on the market today support Wi-Fi wireless networking and many can be used on mobile telephone networks with data capability for example 3G Mobile data plans are supplied under contract in the same way as mobile telephone Some also include ethernet and/or modem ports for broadband or dial-up Internet access respectivel Processor architectures x86 Most netbooks such as those from Asus BenQ Dell Toshiba Acer use the Intel Atom notebook processor typically the N270 1.6GHz but also available is the N280 at 1.66GHz replaced by the N450 series with graphics and memory controller integrated on the chip in early 2010 and running at 1.66GHz but the x86-compatible VIA Technologies C7 processor is also powering netbooks from many different manufacturers like HP and Samsung VIA has also designed the Nano a new x86-64 -compatible architecture targeting lower priced mobile applications like netbook Currently one netbook uses the Nano the Samsung NC20 Some very low cost netbooks use a System-on-a-chip Vortex86 processor meant for embedded systems just to be Windows compatible but with very low performanc In 2011 AMD launched Fusion netbook processors which are included in Asus Eee PC 1015T and many other Although not officially sanctioned by AMD for this role a 1.2GHz Athlon 64 model L110 processor dissipating 13W was used by at least one company Gateway to power a 11.6-inch portable 1366x768 screen resolution described as a netbook by the pres Launched in mid 2009 at $399 in the United States the LT31 met with reviewers approval for its performance being generally recognized as faster than contemporary Atom-based products in the same price range while having a considerably shorter battery life and still falling short of Intel s Core 2 ULV product line powering more expensive small-factor offering The 11.6 inch MacBook Air debuted in late 2010 with a 1.4Ghz Core 2 Duo processor a 10W part and a 1366x768 display resolution for its entry level model priced at $999 with 1.6GHz available as upgrade which put it much closer to a fully modern laptop than the small-but-crippled netbooks One reviewer described it as the The Mercedes Benz of netbooks The September 2011 PC Magazine buyer s guide for netbooks observed that other oversized netbooks with 11.6 inch screens had appeared on the market including the HP Pavilion dm1z MSRP $449 and Lenovo ThinkPad X100e MSRP $550 both using the AMD Fusion

for netbook In particular the recent ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore series of processor cores have been touted by ARM as an alternative platform to x86 for netbook In June 2009 Nvidia announced a dozen mobile Internet devices running ARM based Tegra SoC s some of which will be netbook Some ARM-based products were advertised as smartbooks particularly by Qualcom Smartbooks promised to deliver features including always on all-day battery life 3G connectivity and GPS all typically found in smartphones in a laptop -style body with a screen size of 5 to 10inches and a QWERTY keyboar These systems do not run traditional x86 versions of Microsoft Windows rather custom Linux operating systems such as Google s Android or Chrome OS In the end few such products were ever shipped to market under this branding like the HP-Compaq Airlife the Toshiba AC100 sold as Dynabook AZ in Japan and the Efika MX Some of the devices like the AC100 have been hampered by being sold with a phone-oriented operating system like Androi By the end of 2010 Qualcomm CEO Paul Jacobs admitted that tablet computers such as the iPad already occupied the niche of the smartbook so the name was droppe In 2012 Microsoft

of netbooks in the United States were estimated to ship with Windows XP which Microsoft was later estimated to sell ranging from US$15 to US$35 per netboo Microsoft has extended the availability of Windows XP for ultra-low cost personal computers from June 2008 until June 201 However the discounted license costs only applies to reduced size and functionality netbooks which effectively enables the production of low-cost PCs while preserving the higher margins of mainstream desktops and value laptops as well as avoiding increased use of Linux installations on netbook Microsoft also has Windows 7 Starter for this class of device As of the first quarter of 2009 many netbook models previously announced with Windows XP for the US market were in fact being released with Windows 7 Starter instead at the same price point previously announced for the Windows XP edition However unlike on regular desktops or notebooks that were sold with Vista but included a coupon for 7 users could not get a coupon for 7 Starter if they bought a netboo Windows CE has also been used in netbook applications due to its reduced feature design that keeps with the design philosophy of netbook Some netbooks have also been sold with Windows Vista mostly prior to the release of Windows 7 Many netbooks are by default unable to activate Windows in an enterprise environment using a Microsoft Key

customised Linux distributions are estimated to ship on 32% of netbooks worldwide 0.5% claimed Microsoft making it the second most popular operating system after Window As Linux systems normally install software from an Internet software repository they do not need an optical drive to install softwar As of August 2010 [update] major netbook manufacturers no longer install or support Linux in the United State The reason for this change of stance is unclear although it coincides with the availability of Windows 7 Starter and a strong marketing push for the adoption of this OS in the netbook marke However companies targeting niche markets such as System76 and ZaReason continue to pre-install Linux on the devices they sel Netbooks have sparked the development of several Linux variants or completely new distributions which are optimized for small screen use and the limited processing power of the Atom or ARM processors which typically power netbook Examples include Ubuntu Netbook
