the purchase of one business or company by another company or other business entit Such purchase may be of 100% or nearly 100% of the assets or ownership equity of the acquired entit Consolidation occurs when two companies combine together to form a new enterprise altogether and neither of the previous companies survives independentl Acquisitions are divided into private and public acquisitions depending on whether the acquiree or merging company also termed a target is or is not listed on a public stock market An additional dimension or categorization consists of whether an acquisition is friendly or hostile Achieving acquisition success has proven to be very difficult while various studies have shown that 50% of acquisitions were unsuccessfu The acquisition process is very complex with many dimensions influencing its outcom Whether a purchase is perceived as being a friendly one or a hostile depends significantly on how the proposed acquisition is communicated to and perceived by the target company s board of directors employees and shareholder It is normal for MA deal communications to take place in a so-called confidentiality bubble wherein the flow of information is restricted pursuant to confidentiality agreement In the case of a friendly transaction the companies cooperate in negotiations in the case of a hostile deal the board and/or management of the target is unwilling to be bought or the target s board has no prior knowledge of the offe Hostile acquisitions can and often do ultimately become friendly as the acquiror secures endorsement of the transaction from the board of the acquiree compan This usually requires an improvement in the terms of the offer and/or through negotiatio Acquisition usually refers to a purchase of a smaller firm by a larger on Sometimes however a smaller firm will acquire management control of a larger and/or longer-established company and retain the name of the latter for the post-acquisition combined entit This is known as a reverse takeover Another type of acquisition is the reverse merger a form of transaction that enables a private company to be publicly listed in a relatively short time fram A reverse merger occurs when a privately held company often one that has strong prospects and is eager to raise financing buys a publicly listed shell company usually one with no business and limited asset There are also a variety of structures used in securing control over the assets of a company which have different tax and regulatory implications This section does not cite any references or sources June 2008 The buyer buys the shares and therefore control of the target company being purchase Ownership control of the company in turn conveys effective control over the assets of the company but since the company is acquired intact as a going concern this form of transaction carries with it all of the liabilities accrued by that business over its past and all of the risks that company faces in its commercial environmen The buyer buys the assets of the target compan The cash the target receives from the sell-off is paid back to its shareholders by dividend or through liquidatio This type of transaction leaves the target company as an empty shell if the buyer buys out the entire asset A buyer often structures the transaction as an asset purchase to cherry-pick the assets that it wants and leave out the assets and liabilities that it does no This can be particularly important where foreseeable liabilities may include future unquantified damage awards such as those that could arise from litigation over defective products employee benefits or terminations or environmental damag A disadvantage of this structure is the tax that many jurisdictions particularly outside the United States impose on transfers of the individual assets whereas stock transactions can frequently be structured as like-kind exchanges or other arrangements that are tax-free or tax-neutral both to the buyer and to the seller s shareholder The terms demerger spin-off and spin-out are sometimes used to indicate a situation where one company splits into two generating a second company which may or may not become separately listed on a stock exchang As per knowledge-based views [ clarification needed ] firms can generate greater values through the retention of knowledge-based resources which they generate and integrat Extracting technological benefits during and after acquisition is ever challenging issue because of organizational difference Based on the content analysis of seven interviews authors concluded five following components for their grounded model of acquisition This section does not cite any references or sources July 2012 Improper documentation and changing implicit knowledge makes it difficult to share information during acquisitio For acquired firm symbolic and cultural independence which is the base of technology and capabilities are more important than administrative independenc Detailed knowledge exchange and integrations are difficult when the acquired firm is large and high performin Management of executives from acquired firm is critical in terms of promotions and pay incentives to utilize their talent and value their expertis Transfer of technologies and capabilities are most difficult task to manage because of complications of acquisition implementatio The risk of losing implicit knowledge is always associated with the fast pace acquisitio Preservation of tacit knowledge employees and documentation are often difficult to achieve during and after acquisitio Strategic management of all these resources is a very important factor for a successful acquisitio An increase in acquisitions in the global business environment requires enterprises to evaluate the key stake holders of acquisition very carefully before implementatio [ citation needed ] It is imperative for the acquirer to understand this relationship and apply it to its advantag Retention [ clarification needed ] is only possible when resources are exchanged and managed without affecting their independenc Distinction between mergers and acquisitions The terms merger and acquisition mean slightly different thing The legal concept of a merger with the resulting corporate mechanics statutory merger or statutory consolidation which have nothing to do with the resulting power grab as between the management of the target and the acquirer [ clarification needed ] is different from the business point of view of a merger which can be achieved independently of the corporate mechanics through various means such as triangular merger statutory merger acquisition et When one company takes over another and clearly establishes itself as the new owner the purchase is called an acquisition From a legal point of view in an acquisition the target company still exists as an independent legal entity which is controlled by the acquire In the pure sense of the term a merger happens when two firms agree to go forward as a single new company rather than remain separately owned and operate This kind of action is more precisely referred to as a merger of equals The firms are often of about the same siz Both companies stocks are surrendered and new company stock is issued in its plac For example in the 1999 merger of Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham both firms ceased to exist when they merged and a new company GlaxoSmithKline was create In practice however actual mergers of equals don t happen very ofte Usually one company will buy another and as part of the deal s terms simply allow the acquired firm to proclaim that the action is a merger of equals even if it is technically an acquisitio Being bought out often carries negative connotations therefore by describing the deal euphemistically as a merger deal makers and top managers try to make the takeover more palatabl An example of this would be the takeover of Chrysler by Daimler-Benz in 1999 which was widely referred to as a merger at the tim A purchase deal will also be called a merger when both CEOs agree that joining together is in the best interest of both of their companie But when the deal is unfriendly that is when the target company does not want to be purchased it is always regarded as an acquisition Business valuation The five most common ways to value a business are asset valuation historical earnings valuation future maintainable earnings valuation relative valuation comparable company comparable transactions discounted cash flow DCF valuation Professionals who value businesses generally do not use just one of these methods but a combination of some of them as well as possibly others that are not mentioned above in order to obtain a more accurate valu The information in the balance sheet or income statement is obtained by one of three accounting measures a Notice to Reader a Review Engagement or an Audit Accurate business valuation is one of the most important aspects of MA as valuations like these will have a major impact on the price that a business will be sold fo Most often this information is expressed in a Letter of Opinion of Value LOV when the business is being valuated for interest s sak There are other more detailed ways of expressing the value of a busines While these reports generally get more detailed and expensive as the size of a company increases this is not always the case as there are many complicated industries which require more attention to detail regardless of siz As synergy plays a large role in the valuation of acquisitions it is paramount to get the value of synergies right synergies are different from the sales price valuation of the firm as they will accrue to the buye The analysis should hence be done from the acquiring firm s point of vie Synergy creating investments are started by the choice of the acquirer and therefore they are not obligatory making them real options in essenc To include this real options aspect into analysis of acquisition targets is one interesting issue that has been studied latel Financing MA Accountancy Key concepts Accountant

ROA However economic dilution must prevail towards accounting dilution when making the choic The form of payment and financing options are tightly linke If the buyer pays cash there are three main financing options Cash on hand it consumes financial slack excess cash or unused debt capacity and may decrease debt ratin There are no major transaction cost It consumes financial slack may decrease debt rating and increase cost of deb Transaction costs include underwriting or closing costs of 1% to 3% of the face valu Issue of stock it increases financial slack may improve debt rating and reduce cost of deb Transaction costs include fees for preparation of a proxy statement an extraordinary shareholder meeting and registratio If the buyer pays with stock the financing possibilities are Issue of stock same effects and transaction costs as described above Shares in treasury it increases financial slack if they dont have to be repurchased on the market may improve debt rating and reduce cost of deb Transaction costs include brokerage fees if shares are repurchased in the market otherwise there are no major cost In general stock will create financial flexibilit Transaction costs must also be considered but tend to have a greater impact on the payment decision for larger transaction Finally paying cash or with shares is a way to signal value to the other party e. buyers tend to offer stock when they believe their shares are overvalued and cash when undervalue Specialist MA advisory firms Although at present the majority of MA advice is provided by full-service investment banks recent years have seen a rise in the prominence of specialist MA advisers who only provide MA advice and not financing These companies are sometimes referred to as Merchant Capital Advisors or Advisors assisting businesses often referred to as companies in sellin To perform these services in the US an advisor must be a licensed broker dealer and subject to SEC FINRA regulatio [ citation needed ] Motives The dominant rationale used to explain MA activity is that acquiring firms seek improved financial performanc The following motives are considered to improve financial performance Economy of scale This refers to the fact that the combined company can often reduce its fixed costs by removing duplicate departments or operations lowering the costs of the company relative to the same revenue stream thus increasing profit margin Economy of scope This refers to the efficiencies primarily associated with demand-side changes such as increasing or decreasing the scope of marketing and distribution of different types of product Increased revenue or market share This assumes that the buyer will be absorbing a major competitor and thus increase its market power by capturing increased market share to set price Cross-selling For example a bank buying a stock broker could then sell its banking products to the stock broker s customers while the broker can sign up the bank s customers for brokerage account Or a manufacturer can acquire and sell complementary product Synergy For example managerial economies such as the increased opportunity of managerial specializatio Another example is purchasing economies due to increased order size and associated bulk-buying discount Taxation A profitable company can buy a loss maker to use the target s loss as their advantage by reducing their tax liabilit In the United States and many other countries rules are in place to limit the ability of profitable companies to shop for loss making companies limiting the tax motive of an acquiring compan Geographical or other diversification This is designed to smooth the earnings results of a company which over the long term smoothens the stock price of a company giving conservative investors more confidence in investing in the compan However this does not always deliver value to shareholders see below Resource transfer resources are unevenly distributed across firms Barney 1991 and the interaction of target and acquiring firm resources can create value through either overcoming information asymmetry or by combining scarce resource Vertical integration Vertical integration occurs when an upstream and downstream firm merge or one acquires the other There are several reasons for this to occu One reason is to internalise an externality proble A common example of such an externality is double marginalizatio Double marginalization occurs when both the upstream and downstream firms have monopoly power and each firm reduces output from the competitive level to the monopoly level creating two deadweight losse Following a merger the vertically integrated firm can collect one deadweight loss by setting the downstream firm s output to the competitive leve This increases profits and consumer surplu A merger that creates a vertically integrated firm can be profitabl Hiring some companies use acquisitions as an alternative to the normal hiring proces This is especially common when the target is a small private company or is in the startup phas In this case the acquiring company simply hires the staff of the target private company thereby acquiring its talent if that is its main asset and appeal The target private company simply dissolves and little legal issues are involve [ citation needed ] Absorption of similar businesses under single management similar portfolio invested by two different mutual funds namely united money market fund and united growth and income fund caused the management to absorb united money market fund into united growth and income fun However on average and across the most commonly studied variables acquiring firms financial performance does not positively change as a function of their acquisition activit Therefore additional motives for merger and acquisition that may not add shareholder value include Diversification While this may hedge a company against a downturn in an individual industry it fails to deliver value since it is possible for individual shareholders to achieve the same hedge by diversifying their portfolios at a much lower cost than those associated with a merge In his book One Up on Wall Street Peter Lynch memorably termed this diworseification Manager s hubris manager s overconfidence about expected synergies from MA which results in overpayment for the target compan Empire-building Managers have larger companies to manage and hence more powe Manager s compensation In the past certain executive management teams had their payout based on the total amount of profit of the company instead of the profit per share which would give the team a perverse incentive to buy companies to increase the total profit while decreasing the profit per share which hurts the owners of the company the shareholders Different Types of MA Types of MA by functional roles in market The MA process itself is a multifaceted which depends upon the type of merging companie - A horizontal merger is usually between two companies in the same business secto The example of horizontal merger would be if a health cares system buys another health care syste This means that synergy can obtained through many forms including such as increased market share cost savings and exploring new market opportunitie - A vertical merger represents the buying of supplier of a busines In the same example as above if a health care system buys the ambulance services from their service suppliers is an example of vertical buyin The vertical buying is aimed at reducing overhead cost of operations and economy of scal - Conglomerate MA is the third form of MA process which deals the merger between two irrelevant companie The example of conglomerate MA with relevance to above scenario would be if health care system buys a restaurant chai The objective may be diversification of capital investmen Arm s length mergers An arm s length merger is a merger approved by disinterested directors and approved by disinterested stockholders The two elements are complementary and not substitute The first element is important because the directors have the capability to act as effective and active bargaining agents which disaggregated stockholders do no But because bargaining agents are not always effective or faithful the second element is critical because it gives the minority stockholders the opportunity to reject their agents wor Therefore when a merger with a controlling stockholder was 1 negotiated and approved by a special committee of independent directors and 2 conditioned on an affirmative vote of a majority of the minority stockholders the business judgment standard of review should presumptively apply and any plaintiff ought to have to plead particularized facts that if true support an inference that despite the facially fair process the merger was tainted because of fiduciary wrongdoin Strategic Mergers A Strategic merger usually refers to long term strategic holding of target Acquired fir This type of MA process aims at creating synergies in the long run by increased market share broad customer base and corporate strength of busines A strategic acquirer may also be willing to pay a premium offer to target firm in the outlook of the synergy value created after MA proces MA research and statistics for acquired organizations Given that the cost of replacing an executive can run over 100% of his or her annual salary any investment of time and energy in re-recruitment will likely pay for itself many times over if it helps a business retain just a handful of key players that would have otherwise lef Organizations should move rapidly to re-recruit key manager Its much easier to succeed with a team of quality players that you select deliberately rather than try to win a game with those who randomly show up to pla Brand considerations Mergers and acquisitions often create brand problems beginning with what to call the company after the transaction and going down into detail about what to do about overlapping and competing product brand Decisions about what brand equity to write off are not inconsequentia And given the ability for the right brand choices to drive preference and earn a price premium the future success of a merger or acquisition depends on making wise brand choice Brand decision-makers essentially can choose from four different approaches to dealing with naming issues each with specific pros and cons Keep one name and discontinue the othe The strongest legacy brand with the best prospects for the future lives o In the merger of United Airlines and Continental Airlines the United brand will continue forward while Continental is retire Keep one name and demote the othe The strongest name becomes the company name and the weaker one is demoted to a divisional brand or product bran An example is Caterpillar In keeping the Bucyrus International nam Keep both names and use them togethe Some companies try to please everyone and keep the value of both brands by using them togethe This can create an unwieldy name as in the case of PricewaterhouseCoopers which has since changed its brand name to PwC Discard both legacy names and adopt a totally new on The classic example is the merger of Bell Atlantic with GTE which became Verizon Communications Not every merger with a new name is successfu By consolidating into YRC Worldwide the company lost the considerable value of both Yellow Freight and Roadway Cor The factors influencing brand decisions in a merger or acquisition transaction can range from political to tactica Ego can drive choice just as well as rational factors such as brand value and costs involved with changing brand Beyond the bigger issue of what to call the company after the transaction comes the ongoing detailed choices about what divisional product and service brands to kee The detailed decisions about the brand portfolio are covered under the topic brand architecture History of MA Most histories of MA begin in the late 19th U. However mergers coincide historically with the existence of companie In 1708 for example the East India Company merged with an erstwhile competitor to restore its monopoly over Indian trad In 1784 the Italian Monte dei Paschi and Monte Pio banks were united as the Monti Reunit In 1821 the Hudson s Bay Company merged with the rival North West Company The Great Merger Movement 1895-1905 The Great Merger Movement was a predominantly U. business phenomenon that happened from 1895 to 190 During this time small firms with little market share consolidated with similar firms to form large powerful institutions that dominated their market It is estimated that more than 1,800 of these firms disappeared into consolidations many of which acquired substantial shares of the markets in which they operate The vehicle used were so-called trusts In 1900 the value of firms acquired in mergers was 20% of GDP In 1990 the value was only 3% and from 19982000 it was around 1011% of GD Companies such as DuPont US Steel and General Electric that merged during the Great Merger Movement were able to keep their dominance in their respective sectors through 1929 and in some cases today due to growing technological advances of their products patents and brand recognition by their customer There were also other companies that held the greatest market share in 1905 but at the same time did not have the competitive advantages of the companies like DuPont and General Electric These companies such as International Paper and American Chicle saw their market share decrease significantly by 1929 as smaller competitors joined forces with each other and provided much more competitio The companies that merged were mass producers of homogeneous goods that could exploit the efficiencies of large volume productio In addition many of these mergers were capital-intensiv Due to high fixed costs when demand fell these newly-merged companies had an incentive to maintain output and reduce price However more often than not mergers were quick mergers These quick mergers involved mergers of companies with unrelated technology and different managemen As a result the efficiency gains associated with mergers were not presen The new and bigger company would actually face higher costs than competitors because of these technological and managerial difference Thus the mergers were not done to see large efficiency gains they were in fact done because that was the trend at the tim Companies which had specific fine products like fine writing paper earned their profits on high margin rather than volume and took no part in Great Merger Movemen [ citation needed ] Short-run factors One of the major short run factors that sparked The Great Merger Movement was the desire to keep prices hig However high prices attracted the entry of new firms into the industry who sought to take a piece of the total produc With many firms in a market supply of the product remains hig A major catalyst behind the Great Merger Movement was the Panic of 1893 which led to a major decline in demand for many homogeneous good For producers of homogeneous goods when demand falls these producers have more of an incentive to maintain output and cut prices in order to spread out the high fixed costs these producers faced i. lowering cost per unit and the desire to exploit efficiencies of maximum volume productio However during the Panic of 1893 the fall in demand led to a steep fall in price Another economic model proposed by Naomi Lamoreaux for explaining the steep price falls is to view the involved firms acting as monopolies in their respective market As quasi-monopolists firms set quantity where marginal cost equals marginal revenue and price where this quantity intersects deman When the Panic of 1893 hit demand fell and along with demand the firms marginal revenue fell as wel Given high fixed costs the new price was below average total cost resulting in a los However also being in a high fixed costs industry these costs can be spread out through greater production i. Higher quantity produced To return to the quasi-monopoly model in order for a firm to earn profit firms would steal part of another firms market share by dropping their price slightly and producing to the point where higher quantity and lower price exceeded their average total cos As other firms joined this practice prices began falling everywhere and a price war ensue One strategy to keep prices high and to maintain profitability was for producers of the same good to collude with each other and form associations also known as cartels These cartels were thus able to raise prices right away sometimes more than doubling price However these prices set by cartels only provided a short-term solution because cartel members would cheat on each other by setting a lower price than the price set by the carte Also the high price set by the cartel would encourage new firms to enter the industry and offer competitive pricing causing prices to fall once agai As a result these cartels did not succeed in maintaining high prices for a period of no more than a few year The most viable solution to this problem was for firms to merge through horizontal integration with other top firms in the market in order to control a large market share and thus successfully set a higher pric [ citation needed ] Long-run factors In the long run due to desire to keep costs low it was advantageous for firms to merge and reduce their transportation costs thus producing and transporting from one location rather than various sites of different companies as in the pas Low transport costs coupled with economies of scale also increased firm size by two- to fourfold during the second half of the nineteenth centur In addition technological changes prior to the merger movement within companies increased the efficient size of plants with capital intensive assembly lines allowing for economies of scal Thus improved technology and transportation were forerunners to the Great Merger Movemen In part due to competitors as mentioned above and in part due to the government however many of these initially successful mergers were eventually dismantle The U. government passed the Sherman Act in 1890 setting rules against price fixing and monopolie Starting in the 1890s with such cases as Addyston Pipe and Steel Company United States the courts attacked large companies for strategizing with others or within their own companies to maximize profit Price fixing with competitors created a greater incentive for companies to unite and merge under one name so that they were not competitors anymore and technically not price fixin Merger waves The economic history has been divided into Merger Waves based on the merger activities in the business world as Period Name Facet 18971904 First

more diverse companie Acquirers more frequently bought into different industrie Sometimes this was done to smooth out cyclical bumps to diversify the hope being that it would hedge an investment portfoli Starting in the fourth merger wave 19921998 and continuing today companies are more likely to acquire in the same business or close to it firms that complement and strengthen an acquirers capacity to serve customer Buyers arent necessarily hungry for the target companies hard asset Some are more interested in acquiring thoughts methodologies people and relationship Paul Graham recognized this in his 2005 essay Hiring is Obsolete in which he theorizes that the free market is better at identifying talent and that traditional hiring practices do not follow the principles of free market because they depend a lot upon credentials and university degree Graham was probably the first to identify the trend in which large companies such as Google Yahoo! or Microsoft were choosing to acquire startups instead of hiring new recruit Many companies are being bought for their patents licenses market share name brand research staffs methods customer base or cultur Soft capital like this is very perishable fragile and flui Integrating it usually takes more finesse and expertise than integrating machinery real estate inventory and other tangible Cross-border MA In a study conducted in 2000 by Lehman Brothers it was found that on average large MA deals cause the domestic currency of the target corporation to appreciate by 1% relative to the acquirer s local currenc The rise of globalization has exponentially increased the necessity for MAIC Trust accounts and securities clearing services for Like-Kind Exchanges for cross-border M In 1997 alone there were over 2333 cross-border transactions worth a total of approximately $298 billio Due to the complicated nature of cross-border MA the vast majority of cross-border actions have unsuccessful as companies seek to expand their global footprint and become more agile at creating high-performing businesses and cultures across national boundarie [ citation needed ] Even mergers of companies with headquarters in the same country are can often be considered international in scale and require MAIC custodial service For example when Boeing acquired McDonnell Douglas the two American companies had to integrate operations in dozens of countries around the world 1997 This is just as true for other apparently single country mergers such as the $29 billion dollar merger of Swiss drug makers Sandoz and Ciba-Geigy now Novartis MA failure Despite the goal of performance improvement results from mergers and acquisitions MA are often disappointing compared with results predicted or expecte Numerous empirical studies show high failure rates of MA deal Studies are mostly focused on individual determinant A book by Thomas Straub 2007 Reasons for frequent failure in Mergers and Acquisitions develops a comprehensive research framework that bridges different perspectives and promotes an understanding of factors underlying MA performance in business research and scholarshi The study should help managers in the decision making proces The first important step towards this objective is the development of a common frame of reference that spans conflicting theoretical assumptions from different perspective On this basis a comprehensive framework is proposed with which to understand the origins of MA performance better and address the problem of fragmentation by integrating the most important competing perspectives in respect of studies on MA Furthermore according to the existing literature relevant determinants of firm performance are derived from each dimension of the mode For the dimension strategic management the six strategic variables market similarity market complementarities production operation similarity production operation complementarities market power and purchasing power were identified having an important impact on MA performanc For the dimension organizational behavior the variables acquisition experience relative size and cultural differences were found to be importan Finally relevant determinants of MA performance from the financial field were acquisition premium bidding process and due diligenc Three different ways in order to best measure post MA performance are recognized Synergy realization absolute performance and finally relative performanc Employee turnover contributes to MA failure The turnover in target companies is double the turnover
