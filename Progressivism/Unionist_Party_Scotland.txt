Unionist Party referred to as the Scottish Unionist Party outside of Scotland itself was the main centre right political party in Scotland between 1912 and 196 Use of the terms Unionist and Tory as opposed to Conservative is a consequence of the Scottish Unionists eschewing the name Conservative until 196 Independent of though associated with the Conservative Party in England and Wales it stood for election at different periods of its history in alliance with a small number of Liberal Unionist and National Liberal candidate Those who successfully became Members of Parliament MPs would then take the Conservative Whip at Westminster just as the Ulster Unionists did until 197 At Westminster the differences between the Scottish Unionist and the English party could appear blurred or non-existent to the external casual observer especially as many Scottish MPs were prominent in the parliamentary Conservative party such as party leaders Andrew Bonar Law 1911-1921 1922-1923 and Sir Alec Douglas-Home 1963-1965 both of whom served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom The party traditionally did not stand at local government level but instead supported and assisted the Progressive Party in its campaigns against the British Labour Party This relationship ended when the Conservatives started fielding their own candidates who stood against both Labour and the

External links Origins The origins of the Scottish Unionist Party lie in the 1886 split of the British Liberal Party with the emergence of the Liberal Unionists under Joseph Chamberlain The Union in question was the 1801 Irish Union not that of 1707 Prior to this the only Tory/Conservative party in Scotland was the official Conservative Party which had never achieved parity with the dominant Whig and Scottish Liberal Party ascendancy since the election reforms of 1832 The new Liberal Unionists quickly agreed to an electoral pact with the Conservative Party in Britain and in Scotland this pact overcame the former electoral dominance of the Scottish Liberal After the official 1912 merger of Liberal Unionists and Conservatives in Britain as the Conservative and Unionist Party the Scottish Unionist Party emerged as effectively the Conservative Party in Scotland although some candidates still stood on a Liberal Unionist ticket because of the latent appeal of the word Liberal in Scotlan Ethos and appeal Popular imperial unity was the central thread of the Scottish Unionist Party s belief syste While it was the prospect of Irish Home Rule that set the circumstances for the party s creation it was not the principle of autonomy they opposed but the belief that Irish independence would lead to the break-up of the British Empire This was demonstrated by their acceptance and support of Dominion status for colonies such as Australia Canada New Zealand and Newfoundland This seam in the Scottish Unionist Party s belief system was demonstrated when members of the party left to establish the Scottish Party which eventually merged with the National Party of Scotland to form the Scottish National Party It also explains what may at first seem a paradoxical statement by John Buchan who as a Scottish Unionist MP stated I believe every Scotsman should be a Scottish nationalis While the Scottish party may have been linked on a Parliamentary level with the Conservative and Unionist Party in England and Wales it was conscious that it had to appeal to the liberal tradition in Scotland and studiously avoided using the term Conservative The party built up significant working-class support by emphasising the connection between Union the Empire and the fate of local industr Unity across the classes was often cited as one of the party s planks of Unionis Along with this protectionism Protestantism also played an important part in the party s working-class appea Although not explicitly articulated by the party lest it alienate what small but wealthy middle and upper class Catholic support it had this appeal was projected through the endorsement and promotion of well known Church of Scotland members like John Buchan or prominent Orangemen in areas of west and central Scotland where the Orange Lodge had strong suppor Prominent Orangemen included Sir John Gilmour the intermittent Secretary for Scotland in the 1920s and Home Secretary in the 1930 Some saw this as an anti-Catholic appointment however it was Gilmour who as the Secretary for Scotland repudiated the Church of Scotland s highly controversial report entitled The Menace of the Irish Race to our Scottish Nationality Being an independent Scottish party also drew electoral appeal when set against the threat of a London-based centralising British Labour party A crucial aspect to this particularly in the 1940s and 1950s was the ability to place an alien identity upon Labour by successfully using the term Socialist to describe the Labour Part This distinctively Scottish appeal was further strengthened when combined with opposition to the Labour party s post-war nationalisation programme which centralised control in London of former Scottish owned businesses and council-run service The strong Scottish character of the party was even evident in relations with Conservative government ministers when for example Lord Glendevon admitted he would be at odds with Scotland s Unionist Party for refusing the post of Secretary of State for Scotland because he preferred to remain at Westminster Lord Glendevon s Obituary Scotsman 22/01/1996 Furthermore the party s campaigning reflected their desire to reconcile the two themes of individualism and collectivism in their appeal to potential Labour voter This projected an image of flexibility and pragmatism when they expressed their support for the synthesis of two fundamental ideas of human individuality and of service to others and to the communit Electoral record and the 1955 election Compared to the Conservative Party s pre-1886 record in Scotland as well as the post-1965 Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party the 1912-1965 Scottish Unionist Party s electoral record stands out as a succes [ citation needed ] With the Liberal Party divided and declining the Scottish Unionist Party managed to attract former Liberal voters during this period sometimes with candidates standing on a Liberal Unionist ticke The creation of the National Liberals also assisted the Unionist vot Within this context their support grew and the emergence of the Labour Party as a threat to the middle-classes resulted in the Scottish Unionists achieving a majority of Scottish seats in the 1924 election 37 out of Scotland s 7 Suffering a setback in 1929 they reasserted themselves in the 1931 election during an electoral backlash against the Labour Party that resulted in the creation of the National Government The Scottish Unionist Party won 79% of the Scottish seats that year 58 out of 7 The following election of 1935 returned a reduced majority of 45 MP This remained the situation until Labour s landslide victory in the 1945 election The Unionists won only 30 of the now 71 constituencie In the 1950 election a majority of Labour MPs was returned again but the Scottish Unionist Party closed the gap by returning 32 MP In the subsequent Conservative election victory of 1951 an equal number of Labour and Unionist MPs were returned from Scotland 35 with one solitary Liberal taking the remaining sea With Church of Scotland membership reaching record levels the 1955 election brought unparalleled success as the party gained 50.1% of the vote and 36 of the 71 seats at Westminste Often cited as the only party to achieve a majority of the Scottish vote it should be pointed out that 6 of the Conservative and Unionist MPs were returned that year under the label of Liberal Unionist or National Liberal And this apparent success was the prelude to a number of events that weakened the appeal of both the Scottish Unionist Party and the Scottish Conservative branch that followe Suez and after Only a year after the 1955 triumph one event signalled the unravelling of the thread that had until then united Scottish Unionist support the humiliation of the 1956 Suez Crisis The event was a symbolic end for the British Empire not only was British power seen to be eclipsed by the United States but the unity of the Empire itself came into questio It was at this time that Canada s Lester Pearson led the United Nations calls for a negotiated settlement and even offered Canadian troops as neutral peacekeepers to replace British soldier Furthermore in 1960 Conservative Prime Minister Harold Macmillan made his Winds of Change speech to the South African Parliament This signalled an end to the colonial administration of British Empire overseas possessions and began their emergence as independent state The change in Conservative attitudes to the cohesion of the British Empire had been illustrated earlier in 1958 with the expulsion of the League of Empire Loyalists from the Conservative Party Conference Psychologically these events marked the end of the British Empire and with it the central thread of popular imperial unity which had bolstered the Scottish Unionist Party until the In the 1959 election that saw the Unionists sister Conservative party increase their overall majority in the Commons the Scottish Unionists own vote declined and four MPs lost their seat In the Conservative defeat of 1964 eight more Unionist MPs were los Merger with the Conservative Party With electoral defeat reforms in 1965 brought an end to the Scottish Unionist Party as an independent forc It was a renamed Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party that constitutionally then came under the control of the British part These and further reforms in 1977 saw the Scottish Conservatives transformed into a regional unit with its personnel finance and political offices under the control of the leadership in Londo These changes had serious implications for the Conservatives Scottish identit Set alongside the end of Empire and the emergence of several independent states it witnessed the rise of the Scottish National Party SNP as sections of the old Unionist and Labour nationalist vote swung to the SN This seemingly paradoxical swing from Unionist to SNP can be explained for three reasons the old Scottish Unionist Party s projection as an independent Scottish party opposing a British Labour Party the new use of the name Conservative viewed as rather English and the Unionist-Nationalist tradition of John Buchan and others who had founded the Scottish Party Consequences of merger As the British Empire came to an end so too did the primacy of Protestant associations as secularism and ecumenism ros The decline of strictly Protestant associations and the loss of its Protestant working-class base spelled the erosion of the Unionist vot Though many Conservatives would still identify with the Kirk most members of the established Church of Scotland did not identify themselves as Conservative With the Daily Record newspaper switching from the Unionists to Labour the Conservative Party in the 1960s was mercilessly portrayed as a party of the Anglicised aristocracy Combined with the new name this helped switch previous Unionist voters to the Labour party and the SNP which advanced considerably in the elections of February and October 197 The relations between the Scottish Conservatives with the largely working-class Orange Order also became problematic because of the perceived aristocratic connection of the former but it was the Troubles in Northern Ireland that created more concrete problem On one level there was the residual perception of a connection that many mainstream Protestant voters associated with the sectarian violence in Northern Ireland a perception that is unfair to a large extent since the Scottish Orange Order has dealt more stringently with members associating with Northern Irish paramilitaries than its Irish equivalen However the ramifications of this perception also led to the Scottish Conservative Party downplaying and ignoring past associations which further widened the gap with the Orange Orde Any links that lingered were ultimately broken when Margaret Thatcher signed the Anglo-Irish Agreement This event witnessed the Orange Lodge amongst other supporters setting up its own Scottish Unionist Party Electoral performance This chart shows the electoral results of the Scottish
