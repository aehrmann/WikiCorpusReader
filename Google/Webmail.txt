The term Webmail or Web-based email is used to describe two thing One use of the word is to describe a Webmail client an email client implemented as a web application accessed via a web browser This article focuses on this use of the ter The other use of the word is to describe a Web-based email service an email service offered through a web site a webmail provider such as Gmail Yahoo! Mail Hotmail and AOL Mail Practically every webmail provider offers email access using a webmail client and many of them also offer email access by a desktop email client using standard email protocols while many internet service providers provide a webmail client as part of the email service included in their internet service packag As with any web application webmail s main advantage over the use of a desktop email client is the ability to send and receive email anywhere from a web browser Its main disadvantage is the need to be connected to the internet while using it Gmail offers offline use of its webmail client through the installation of Gears There exist also other software tools to integrate parts of the webmail functionality into the OS e. creating messages directly from third party applications via MAPI 1 History 1.1 Early implementations 1.2 Widespread deployment 2 Rendering and compatibility 3 Privacy concerns 4 See also 5 References History Early implementations In the early days of the web in 1994 and 1995 several people were working on enabling email to be accessed via a web browse In Europe there were two implementations Soren Vejrum s WWW Mail and Luca Manunza s WebMail whereas in the United States Matt Mankins wrote Webex All three of these early applications were perl scripts that included the full source code available for downloa Also in 1994 Bill Fitler while at Lotus cc Mail in Mountain View California began working on an implementation of web-based email as a CGI program written in C on Windows NT and demonstrated it publicly at Lotusphere on January 24 199 Soren Vejrum s WWW Mail was written when he was studying and working at the Copenhagen Business School in Denmark and was released on February 28 199 Luca Manunza s WebMail was written while he was working at CRS4 in Sardinia with the first source release on March 30 199 In the United States Matt Mankins under the supervision of D Burt Rosenberg at the University of Miami released his Webex application source code in a post to comp.mail.misc on August 8 1995 although it had been in use as the primary email application at the School of Architecture where Mankins worked for some months prio Meanwhile Bill Fitler s webmail implementation was further developed as a commercial product which Lotus announced and released in the fall of 1995 as cc Mail for the World Wide Web 1.0 thereby providing an alternative means of accessing a cc Mail message store the usual means being a cc Mail desktop application that operated either via dialup or within the confines of a local area network Early commercialization of webmail was also achieved when Webex with no relation to the web conferencing companybegan to be sold by Mankins company DotShop Inc. at the end of 199 Within DotShop Webex changed its name to EMUmail which would be sold to companies like UPS and Rackspace until its sale to Accurev in 200 EMUmail was one of the first applications to feature a free version that included embedded advertising as well as a licensed version that did no As Hotmail developed a foothold on the free email address market EMUmail started MollyMail a service to let you check your existing email from the we After the Accurev acquisition the EMUmail webmail line was killed in favor of the SMTP.com email delivery service which is still sold toda Widespread deployment As the 1990s progressed and into the 2000s it became more common for the general public to have access to webmail because many Internet service providers such as EarthLink and web hosting providers such as Verio began bundling webmail into their service offerings often in parallel with POP SMTP services many other enterprises such as universities and large corporations also started offering webmail as a way for their user communities to access their email either locally managed or outsourced webmail service providers such as Hotmail and RocketMail emerged in 1996 as a free service to the general public and rapidly gained in popularit In some cases webmail application software is developed in-house by the organizations running and managing the application and in some cases it is obtained from software companies that develop and sell such applications usually as part of an integrated mail server package an early example being Netscape Messaging Server The market for webmail application software has continued into the 2010s Rendering and compatibility Email users may find the use of both a webmail client and a desktop client using the POP3 protocol presents some difficultie For example email messages that are downloaded by the desktop client and are removed from the server will no longer be available on the webmail clien The user is limited to previewing messages using the web client before they are downloaded by the desktop email clien By contrast the use of both a webmail client and a desktop client using the IMAP4 protocol allows the contents of the mailbox to be consistently displayed in both the webmail and desktop clients and any action the user performs on messages in one interface will be reflected when email is accessed via the other interfac There are significant differences in rendering capabilities for many popular webmail services such as Yahoo! Mail Gmail and Windows Live Hotmail Due to the varying treatment of HTML tags such as style and head as well as CSS rendering inconsistencies email marketing companies rely on older web development techniques to send cross-platform mai This usually means a greater reliance on tables and inline stylesheet Privacy concerns Main article Email privacy Although every email service provider can read the emails stored on its servers unless encrypted specific concerns have been raised about webmai Most popular webmail services tend to use so-called targeting ads and online spam-filters instead of a client-based filter These services search through email for certain target words and even though service providers may claim that no human reads the emails some providers have been forced to make it possible for users to opt out of this featur Because web browsing is the expected way of viewing the inbox webmail providers store emails for a longer time than usual providers which often delete the email from their servers after they have sent it to the email clien Another concern is the fact that most webmail service providers are based in the U.S. and are therefore subject to the Patriot Act which means that U. authorities can demand that a company must hand over whatever information it has about a user without necessarily letting the user know regardless of the country in which the user lives or where the information is store See also Comparison of webmail providers Comparison of mail servers Comparison of email clients Email hosting service L- or letter mail email letter and letter email References Brownlow Mark Email and webmail statistics Email Marketing Reports January 2009 Offline Gmail Official Gmail Blog January 27 2009 MAPI4Webmail Affixa Creating messages directly from Windows applications via MAPI Vejrum.dk WWW Mail Client website Pinna Alberto Soru un incontro con Rubbia cos nacque il web in Sardegna Corriere della Sera December 28 1999 in Italian Ferrucci Luca The ICT in Sardinia Start up and evolution a b comp.mail.misc Webex Announcement August 8 199 Lotusphere 95 Presentation cc Mail Mobile s Next Generation January 24 199 InfoWorld Lotus cc Mail to get better server mobile access February 6 1995 InformationWeek Surfing the net for e-mail October 16 199 Business Wire Recourse Technologies appoints Vice President of Engineering November 3 200 comp.internet.net-happenings ANNOUNCE WWW Mail Client 1.00 February 28 199 comp.internet.net-happenings WebMail Source code release March 30 199 Miami.edu CV D Burton Rosenberg Network World Lotus readies cc Mail-Web hooks part 2 September 4 1995 p 1 5 PR Newswire Lotus announces cc Mail for the World Wide Web September 26 199 InfoWorld cc Mail users will get E-mail through Web October 2 1995 1 Network World More from Lotus X.500 and the Web October 2 1995 1 EMUmail.com EMUmail website About.com Mollymail Review SMTP.com SMTP.com website Oracle Release Notes Netscape Messaging Server 4.15 Cnet Archive Netscape Messaging Server Corporate Edition Google s Gmail sparks privacy row BBC New April 5 2004 Retrieved July 6 2011 Hotmail Advertising Microsoft Retrieved July 6 2011 a b How Gmail Ads work Google Retrieved July 6 2011 Yahoo lets users opt out of targeted advertising CNET New August 8 2008 Retrieved July 6 2011 Amerikanska myndigheter kan lsa dina mejl in Swedish Sv July 5 2011 Retrieved July 6 2011 Zack Whittake June 28 2011 Microsoft admits Patriot Act can access EU-based cloud data ZDNet Retrieved July 6 2011 Retrieved from Categories Web applications Webmail Email clients Hidden categories Use mdy dates from October 2012
