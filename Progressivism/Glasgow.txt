Glasgow The present site of Glasgow has been used since prehistoric times for settlement due to it being the furthest downstream fording point of the River Clyde at the point of its confluence with the Molendinar Burn The origins of Glasgow as an established city derive ultimately from its medieval position as Scotland s second largest bishopri Glasgow increased in importance during the 10th and 11th centuries as the site of this bishopric reorganised by King David I of Scotland and John Bishop of Glasgow There had been an earlier religious site established by Saint Mungo in the 6th centur The bishopric became one of the largest and wealthiest in the Kingdom of Scotland bringing wealth and status to the tow Between 1175 and 1178 this position was strengthened even further when Bishop Jocelin obtained for the episcopal settlement the status of Burgh from King William I of Scotland allowing the settlement to expand with the benefits of trading monopolies and other legal guarantee Sometime between 1189 and 1195 this status was supplemented by an annual fair which survives to this day as the Glasgow Fair Glasgow grew over the following centuries the first bridge over the River Clyde at Glasgow was recorded from around 1285 giving its name to the Briggait area of the city forming the main North-South route over the river via Glasgow Cross The founding of the University of Glasgow in 1451 and elevation of the bishopric to become the Archdiocese of Glasgow in 1492 served to increase the town s religious and educational statu Glasgow was subsequently raised to the status of Royal burgh in 161 Daniel Defoe visited the city in the early 18th century and famously opined in his book A tour thro the Whole Island of Great Britain that Glasgow was the cleanest and beautifullest and best built city in Britain London excepte At that time the city s population numbered approximately 12,000 and was yet to undergo the massive expansionary changes to the city s economy and urban fabric brought about by the influences of the Scottish Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution Trading port After the Acts of Union in 1707 Scotland gained trading access to the vast markets of the new British Empire and Glasgow became prominent in international commerce as a hub of trade to the Americas especially in the movement of tobacco cotton and sugar into the deep water port that had been created by the city s Tobacco Lords at Port Glasgow on the Firth of Clyde due to the shallowness of the river within the city itself at that tim By the late 18th century more than half of the British tobacco trade was concentrated on Glasgow s River Clyde with over 47,000,000 lb 21,000,000 kg of tobacco being imported at its pea Industrialisation Shipping on the Clyde Atkinson Grimshaw 1881 In its subsequent industrial era Glasgow produced textiles chemicals engineered goods and steel which were exporte The opening of the Monkland Canal and basin linking to the Forth and Clyde Canal at Port Dundas in 1795 facilitated access to the iron-ore and coal mines in Lanarkshire After extensive River engineering projects to dredge and deepen the River Clyde as far as Glasgow shipbuilding became a major industry on the upper stretches of the river pioneered by industrialists such as Robert Napier John Elder George Thomson Sir William Pearce and Sir Alfred Yarrow The River Clyde also became an important source of inspiration for artists such as John Atkinson Grimshaw James Kay and Lowry willing to depict the new industrial era and the modern worl Glasgow s population had surpassed that of Edinburgh by 182 The development of civic institutions included the City of Glasgow Police in 1800 one of the first municipal police forces in the worl Despite the crisis caused by the City of Glasgow Bank s collapse in 1878 growth continued and by the end of the 19th century it was one of the cities known as the Second City of the Empire and was producing more than half Britain s tonnage of shipping and a quarter of all locomotives in the worl Vast numbers of Irish Catholic immigrants poured into the city at this time especially from County Donegal in Ulster Significant Irish Catholic immigration into the city again especially from County Donegal would continue for most of the 20th-centur During this period the construction of many of the city s greatest architectural masterpieces and most ambitious civil engineering projects such as the Loch Katrine aqueduct Subway Tramway system City Chambers Mitchell Library and Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum were being funded by its wealt The city also held a series of International Exhibitions at Kelvingrove Park in 1888 1901 and 1911 with the Empire Exhibition subsequently held in 193 The regeneration of Glasgow has focused on creating new buildings such as the Glasgow Science Centre The 20th century witnessed both decline and renewal in the cit After World War I the city suffered from the impact of the PostWorld War I recession and from the later Great Depression this also led to a rise of radical socialism and the Red Clydeside movemen The city had recovered by the outbreak of World War II and grew through the post-war boom that lasted through the 1950 By the 1960s a lack of investment and innovation led to growing overseas competition in countries like Japan and Germany which weakened the once pre-eminent position of many of the city s industrie As a result of this Glasgow entered a lengthy period of relative economic decline and rapid de-industrialisation leading to high unemployment urban decay population decline welfare dependency and poor health for the city s inhabitant There were active attempts at regeneration of the city when the Glasgow Corporation published its controversial Bruce Report which set out a comprehensive series of initiatives aimed at turning round the decline of the cit There are also accusations that the Scottish Office had deliberately attempted to undermine Glasgow s economic and political influence in post-war Scotland by diverting inward investment in new industries to other regions during the Silicon Glen boom and creating the new towns of Cumbernauld Glenrothes Irvine Livingston and East Kilbride dispersed across the Scottish Lowlands in order to halve the city s population bas By the late 1980s there had been a significant resurgence in Glasgow s economic fortune The Glasgow s miles better campaign launched in 1983 and opening of the Burrell Collection in 1983 and Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre in 1985 facilitated Glasgow s new role as a European centre for business services and finance and promoted an increase in tourism and inward investmen The latter continues to be bolstered by the legacy of the city s Glasgow Garden Festival in 1988 its status as European City of Culture in 1990 and concerted attempts to diversify the city s econom This economic revival has persisted and the ongoing regeneration of inner-city areas including the large-scale Clyde Waterfront Regeneration has led to more affluent people moving back to live in the centre of Glasgow fuelling allegations of gentrification The city now resides in the Mercer index of top 50 safest cities in the world and is considered by Lonely Planet to be one of the world s top 10 tourist citie Despite Glasgow s economic renaissance the East End of the city remains the focus of severe social deprivatio A Glasgow Economic Audit report published in 2007 stated that the gap between prosperous and deprived areas of the city is widenin In 2006 47% of Glasgow s population lived in the most deprived 15% of areas in Scotland while the Centre for Social Justice reported 29.4% of the city s working-age residents to be economically inactive Although marginally behind the UK average Glasgow still has a higher employment rate than Birmingham Liverpool and Mancheste Toponymy It is common to derive the name Glasgow from the older Cumbric glas cau or a Middle Gaelic cognate which would have meant green hollow The settlement probably had an earlier Cumbric name Cathures the modern name appears for the first time in the Gaelic period 1116 as Glasgu It is also recorded that the King of Strathclyde Rhydderch Hael welcomed Saint Kentigern also known as Saint Mungo and procured his consecration as bishop about 54 For

preaching of Your word and the praising of Your nam The coat of arms of the City of Glasgow was granted to the royal burgh by the Lord Lyon on 25 October 186 It incorporates a number of symbols and emblems associated with the life of Glasgow s patron saint Mungo which had been used on official seals prior to that dat The emblems represent miracles supposed to have been performed by Mungo and are listed in the traditional rhyme Here s the bird that never flew Here s the tree that never grew Here s the bell that never rang Here s the fish that never swam St Mungo is also said to have preached a sermon containing the words Lord Let Glasgow flourish by the preaching of the word and the praising of thy name This was abbreviated to Let Glasgow Flourish and adopted as the city s mott The motto was more recently commemorated in a song called Mother Glasgow which was written by Dundonian singer/songwriter Michael Marra but popularised by Hue and Cry In 1450 John Stewart the first Lord Provost of Glasgow left an endowment so that a St Mungo s Bell could be made and tolled throughout the city so that the citizens would pray for his sou A new bell was purchased by the magistrates in 1641 and that bell is still on display in the People s Palace Museum near Glasgow Green The supporters are two salmon bearing rings and the crest is a half length figure of Saint Mung He wears a bishop s mitre and liturgical vestments and has his hand raised in the act of benediction The original 1866 grant placed the crest atop a helm but this was removed in subsequent grant The current version 1996 has a gold mural crown between the shield and the cres This form of coronet resembling an embattled city wall was allowed to the four area councils with city statu The arms were re-matriculated by the City

pioneer in the municipal socialist movement from the late 19th century since the Representation of the People Act 1918 Glasgow increasingly supported Left-wing ideas and politics at a national leve The city council has been controlled by the Labour Party for 30 years since the decline of the Progressives The left-wing support emanates from the city s legacy as an industrial powerhouse and the relative poverty of many Glaswegian constituencies and wards In the aftermath of the Russian Revolution of 1917 and German Revolution of 19181919 the city s frequent strikes and Militant organisations caused serious alarm at Westminster with one uprising in January 1919 prompting the Prime Minister David Lloyd George to deploy 10,000 troops and tanks onto the city s street A huge demonstration in the city s George Square on 31 January ended in violence after the Riot Act was rea Since 2007 when local government elections in Scotland began to use the Single Transferable Vote rather than First
