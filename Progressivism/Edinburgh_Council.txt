1973 Edinburgh was administered by the single tier Edinburgh Corporation which covered the City and Royal Burgh of Edinburgh Edinburgh Corporation was responsible for almost all local government services such as the Edinburgh Corporation Tramways which closed in 1956 Midlothian County Council which had its headquarters on George IV Bridge in Edinburgh was largely responsible for some local government services in Midlothian but outside the city boundaries Some of the towns in Midlothian such as Dalkeith also had their own Burgh Counci In 1975 Edinburgh Corporation and Midlothian County Council were both abolishe The new two-tier system consisted of Lothian Regional Council with responsibility for water education social work and transport and the City of Edinburgh District Council with responsibility for cleansing and libraries The City of Edinburgh became a single-tier council area in 1996 under the Local Government et Scotland Act 1994 with the boundaries of the City of Edinburgh district of the Lothian region Confusion between the responsibilities of the Regional and District Councils and the desire for the avoidance of duplication led to the creation of a single tier council The district had been created in 1975 under the Local Government Scotland Act 1973 to include the former county of city of Edinburgh the former burgh of Queensferry Kirkliston and part of Winchburgh formerly within the county of West Lothian and Currie and Cramond formerly within the county of Midlothian Parliament of the United Kingdom For elections to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom the city is divided among five constituencies each of which elects one Member of Parliament MP by the first past the post system of electio All five constituencies are entirely within the city are Prior to the United Kingdom general election 2005 Edinburgh House of Commons constituencies had exactly the same names and boundaries as the Scottish Parliament constituencies listed abov However in order to reduce Scotland s historical over representation in the House of Commons Scotland s share of constituencies was reduced from 72 to 59 in accordance with proposals drawn up by the Boundary Commission for Scotland The Scottish Parliament Constituencies Act 2004 enabled Scottish Parliament constituencies to remain unaltered despite new arrangements for House of Commons constituencies which resulted in the loss of one Edinburgh constituency and redrawing of boundaries for the other As a result of the boundary review Edinburgh Central constituency was abolished and split between the original Edinburgh North and Leith and Edinburgh West constituencies and an entirely new constituency that was created - Edinburgh South West Edinburgh East and Musselburgh took in parts of the Edinburgh North and Leith seat with the town of Musselburgh being transferred into the East Lothian constituency with the new seat renamed Edinburgh East Edinburgh Pentlands constituency was also divided between the new Edinburgh South West seat and the existing Edinburgh South sea Edinburgh North and Leith was increased in size by taking in parts of the old Edinburgh Central constituenc Edinburgh South was expanded in size taking in elements of the old Edinburgh Pentlands sea Edinburgh South West was an entirely new constituency created for the 2005 UK
