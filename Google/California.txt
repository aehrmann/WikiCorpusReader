once referred to a large area of North America claimed by Spain that included much of modern-day Southwestern United States and the Baja California peninsula Beginning in the late 18th century the area known as Alta California comprising the California territory north of the Baja Peninsula was colonized by the Spanish Empire as part of New Spain In 1821 Alta California became a part of Mexico following its successful war for independenc Shortly after the beginning of the Mexican-American War in 1846 a group of American settlers in Sonoma declared an independent California Republic in Alta Californi Though its existence was short-lived its flag became the precursor for California s current state fla American victory in the war led to the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo in which Mexico ceded Alta California to the United State Western areas of Alta California became the state of California which was admitted as the 31st state on September 9 185 The California Gold Rush beginning in 1848 led to dramatic social and demographic change with large scale immigration from the U. and abroad and an accompanying economic boo Key developments in the early 20th century included the emergence of Los Angeles as the center of the American entertainment industry and the growth of a large state-wide tourism secto The late 20th century saw the development of the technology and information sectors punctuated by the growth of Silicon Valley California s prosperous agricultural industry also emerged at least half of the fresh fruit produced in the United States are now cultivated in California and the state also leads in the production of vegetable Other important contributors to its economy include aerospace education and manufacturin If California were a country it would have the 8th

states of California Nevada and Utah and parts of Arizona New Mexico and Wyoming The name California is most commonly believed to have derived from a fictional paradise peopled by Black Amazons and ruled by Queen Calafia The story of Calafia is recorded in a 1510 work The Adventures of Esplandin written as a sequel to Amadis de Gaula by Spanish adventure writer Garci Rodrguez de Montalvo The kingdom of Queen Calafia according to Montalvo was said to be a remote land inhabited by griffins and other strange beasts and rich in gol Know ye that at the right hand of the Indies there is an island called California very close to that part of the Terrestrial Paradise which was inhabited by black women without a single man among them and they lived in the manner of Amazon They were robust of body with strong passionate hearts and great virtu The island itself is one of the wildest in the world on account of the bold and craggy rock Chapter CLVII of The Adventures of Esplandin The name California is the fifth oldest surviving European place-name in the US and was applied to what is now the southern tip of Baja California peninsula as the Island of California by a Spanish expedition led by Diego de Becerra and Fortn Ximnez who landed there in 1533 at the behest of Hernn Corts [ note 1 ] Geography Main article Geography of California A topographic map of California A view of the

Mexican state of Baja California to the sout With an area of 160,000 square miles 414,000km 2 it is the 3rd largest state in the United States in size after Alaska and Texa If it were a country California would be the 59th- largest in the world in area In the middle of the state lies the California Central Valley bounded by the coastal mountain ranges in the west the Sierra Nevada to the east the Cascade Range in the north and the Tehachapi Mountains in the sout The Central Valley is California s agricultural heartland and grows approximately one-third of the nation s foo Divided in two by the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta the northern portion the Sacramento Valley serves as the watershed of the Sacramento River while the southern portion the San Joaquin Valley is the watershed for the San Joaquin River both areas derive their names from the rivers that transit the With dredging the Sacramento and the San Joaquin Rivers have remained sufficiently deep that several inland cities are seaports The Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta serves as a critical water supply hub for the stat Water is routed through an extensive network of canals and pumps out of the delta that traverse nearly the length of the state including the Central Valley Project and the State Water Projec Water from the Delta provides drinking water for nearly 23 million people almost two-thirds of the state s population and provides water to farmers on the west side of the San Joaquin Valle The Channel Islands are located off the southern coast The Sierra Nevada Spanish for snowy range

during the last 10,000 years California was one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse areas in pre-Columbian North America The Indigenous peoples of California included more than 70 distinct groups of Native Americans ranging from large settled populations living on the coast to groups in the interio California groups also were diverse in their political organization with bands tribes villages and on the resource-rich coasts large chiefdoms such as the Chumash Pomo and Salinan Trade intermarriage and military alliances fostered many social and economic relationships among the diverse group The first European to explore the coast as far north as the Russian River was the Portuguese Juan Rodrguez Cabrillo in 154 Some 37 years later English explorer Francis Drake also explored and claimed an undefined portion of the California coast in 157 Spanish traders made unintended visits with the Manila Galleons on their return trips from the Philippines beginning in 156 Sebastin Vizcano explored and mapped the coast of California in 1602 for New Spain Spanish missionaries began setting up 21 California Missions along the coast of what became known as Alta California Upper California together with small towns and presidios 19th century The Russians from Alaska established their largest settlement in California Fort Ross in 1812 San Francisco harbor 185 Between 1847 and 1870 the population of San Francisco increased from 500 to 150,000 Chinese gold miners in California In 1821 the Mexican War of Independence gave Mexico including California independence from Spain for the next 25 years Alta California remained a remote northern province of the nation of Mexic Cattle ranches or ranchos emerged as the dominant institutions of Mexican Californi After Mexican independence from Spain the chain of missions became the property of the Mexican government and were secularized by 183 The ranchos developed under ownership by Californios Spanish-speaking Californians who had received land grants and traded cowhides and tallow with Boston merchant In 1846 settlers rebelled against Mexican rule during the Bear Flag Revolt Afterwards rebels raised the Bear Flag featuring a bear a star a red stripe and the words California Republic at Sonom The Republic s first and only president was William Ide who played a pivotal role during the Bear Flag Revol Beginning in the 1820s trappers and settlers from the U. and Canada began to arrive in Northern Californi These new arrivals used the Siskiyou Trail California Trail Oregon Trail and Old Spanish Trail to cross the rugged mountains and harsh deserts surrounding Californi In this period Imperial Russia explored the California coast and established a trading post at Fort Ross The California Republic was short lived the same year marked the outbreak of the Mexican-American War 18461848 When Commodore John Sloat of the United States Navy sailed into Monterey Bay and began the military occupation of California by the United States Northern California capitulated in less than a month to the U. force After a series of defensive battles in Southern California the Treaty of Cahuenga was signed by the Californios on January 13 1847 securing American control in Californi Following the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo that ended the war the region was divided between Mexico and the U. the western territory of Alta California was to become the U. state of California and Arizona Nevada Colorado and Utah became U. Territories while the lower region of California the Baja Peninsula remained in the possession of Mexico In 1848 the non-native population of California was estimated to be no more than 15,00 After

the Compromise of 1850 California was admitted to the United States undivided as a free state denying the expansion of slavery to the Pacific Coas California s native population precipitously declined above all from Eurasian diseases to which they had no natural immunit Like in other states the native inhabitants were forcefully removed from their lands by incoming miners ranchers and farmer And despite the fact that California entered the union as a free state the loitering or orphaned Indians were de facto enslaved by Mexican and Anglo-American masters under the 1853 Act for the Government and Protection of Indians There were several massacres in which hundreds of indigenous people were kille Between 1850 and 1860 California paid around 1.5 million dollars some 250,000 of which was reimbursed by the federal government to hire militias whose purpose was to protect settlers from the indigenous population In subsequent decades the native population was placed in reservations and rancherias which were often very small and isolated and lacked adequate natural resources or funding from the government to sustain the populations living on the As a result the rise of California brought great hardship for the native inhabitant Several scholars and Native American activists including Benjamin Madley and Ed Castillo have described the actions of the California government as a genocid The seat of government for California under Spanish and later Mexican rule was located at Monterey from 1777 until 184 In 1849 the Constitutional Convention was first held ther Among the duties was the task of determining the location for the new state capita The first legislative sessions were held in San Jose 18501851 Subsequent locations included Vallejo 18521853 and nearby Benicia 18531854 these locations eventually proved to be inadequate as wel The capital has been located in Sacramento since 1854 with only a short break in 1861 when legislative sessions were held in San Francisco due to flooding in Sacrament Initially travel between California and the rest of the continental U. was time consuming and dangerou A more direct connection came in 1869 with the completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad through Donner Pass in the Sierra Nevada mountain Once completed hundreds of thousands of U. citizens came west where new Californians were discovering that land
