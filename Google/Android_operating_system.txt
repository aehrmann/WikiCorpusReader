The first commercially available phone to run Android was the HTC Dream released on October 22 200 In 2010 Google launched its Nexus series of devices - a line smartphones and tablets running the Android operating system and built by a manufacturer partne HTC collaborated with Google to release the first Nexus smartphone the Nexus One in early 201 The series has since been updated with newer devices such as the Galaxy Nexus phone and Nexus 7 tablet made by Samsung and Asus respectivel Google releases the Nexus phones and tablets to act as their flagship Android devices demonstrating Android s latest software and hardware feature Description See also List of features in Android Interface An HTC Evo 4G s homescreen showing the status bar a clock and weather widget and several app shortcuts Android s user interface is based on direct manipulation using touch inputs that loosely correspond to real-world actions like swiping tapping pinching and reverse pinching to manipulate on-screen object The response to user input is designed to be immediate and provides a fluid touch interfac Internal hardware such as accelerometers gyroscopes and proximity sensors are used by some applications to respond to additional user actions for example adjusting the screen from portrait to landscape depending on how the device is oriented or allowing the user to steer a vehicle in a racing game by rotating the device simulating control of a steering wheel Android devices boot to the homescreen the primary navigation and information point on the device which is similar to the desktop found on PC Android homescreens are typically made up of app icons and widgets app icons launch the associated app whereas widgets display live auto-updating content such as the weather forecast the user s email inbox or a news ticker directly on the homescree A homescreen may be made up of several pages that the user can swipe back and forth betwee Present along the top of the screen is a status bar showing information about the device and its connectivit This status bar can be pulled down to reveal a notification screen where apps display important information or updates such as a newly received email or SMS text in a way that doesn t immediately interrupt or inconvenience the use In early versions of Android these notifications could be tapped to open the relevant app but recent updates have provided enhanced functionality such as the ability to call a number back directly from the missed call notification without having to open the dialer app firs Notifications are persistent until read or dismissed by the use Applications Play Store on the Galaxy Nexus See also Android software development and Google Play Applications are usually developed in the Java language using the Android Software Development Kit but other development tools are available including a Native Development Kit for applications or extensions in C or C++ Google App Inventor a visual environment for novice programmers and various cross platform mobile web applications frameworks Applications can be acquired by end-users either through an app store such as Google Play or the Amazon Appstore or by downloading and installing the application s APK file from a third-party sit The Play Store application allows users to browse download and update apps published by Google and third-party developers hosted on Google Play and is pre-installed on devices that comply with Google s compatibility requirement The app filters the list of available applications to those that are compatible with the user s device and developers may restrict their applications to particular carriers or countries for business reason As of September 2012 there were more than 675,000 apps available for Android and the estimated number of applications downloaded from the Play Store was 25 billio The operating system itself is installed on 400 million total device In order to work around limitations on reaching Google services due to Internet censorship in the People s Republic of China Android devices sold in the PRC are generally customized to use state approved services instea Development Linux Architecture diagram Android consists of a kernel based on the Linux kernel 2.6 and Linux Kernel 3.x Android 4.0 onwards with middleware libraries and APIs written in C and application software running on an application framework which includes Java-compatible libraries based on Apache Harmony Android uses the Dalvik virtual machine with just-in-time compilation to run Dalvik dex-code Dalvik Executable which is usually translated from Java bytecod The main hardware platform for Android is the ARM architecture There is support for x86 from the Android x86 project and Google TV uses a special x86 version of Androi Android s linux kernel has further architecture changes by Google outside the typical Linux kernel development cycl Android does not have a native X Window System by default nor does it support the full set of standard GNU libraries and this makes it difficult to port existing Linux applications or libraries to Androi But the support of simple C and SDL applications is possible by injection of a small Java shim and usage of the JNI like e. in the Jagged Alliance 2 port for Androi Certain features that Google contributed back to the Linux kernel notably a power management feature called wakelocks were rejected by mainline kernel developers partly because kernel maintainers felt that Google did not show any intent to maintain their own cod Even though Google announced in April 2010 that they would hire two employees to work with the Linux kernel community Greg Kroah-Hartman the current Linux kernel maintainer for the -stable branch said in December 2010 that he was concerned that Google was no longer trying to get their code changes included in mainstream Linu Some Google Android developers hinted that the Android team was getting fed up with the process because they were a small team and had more urgent work to do on Androi Linux included the autosleep and wakelocks capabilities in the 3.5 kernel after many previous attempts at merge The interfaces are the same but the upstream Linux implementation allows for two different suspend modes to memory the traditional suspend that android uses and to disk hibernate as it is known on the desktop In August 2011 Linus Torvalds said that eventually Android and Linux would come back to a common kernel but it will probably not be for four to five years In December 2011 Greg Kroah-Hartman announced the start of the Android Mainlining Project which aims to put some Android drivers patches and features back into the Linux kernel starting in Linux 3. further integration being expected for Linux Kernel 3. The flash storage on Android devices is split into several partitions such as system for the operating system itself and data for user data and app installation In contrast to desktop Linux distributions Android device owners are not given root access to the operating system and sensitive partitions such as system are read-only However root access can be obtained by exploiting security flaws in Android which is used frequently by the open source community to enhance the capabilities of their devices but also by malicious parties to install viruses and malware Memory management Since Android devices are usually battery-powered Android is designed to manage memory RAM to keep power consumption at a minimu This contrasts with desktop operating systems which generally assume they are connected to the mains electricity and use as much power as they lik When an Android app is no longer in use the system will automatically suspend it in memory - while the app is still technically open suspended apps consume no resources e. battery power or processing power and sit idly in the background until needed agai This has the dual benefit of increasing the general responsiveness of the device since apps don t need to be closed and reopened from scratch each time but also ensuring background apps don t waste power needlessl Android manages the apps stored in memory automatically when memory is low the system will begin killing apps and processes that have been inactive for a while in reverse order since they were last used i. oldest first This process is designed to be invisible to the user such that users do not need to manage memory or the killing of apps themselve Confusion over Android memory management has resulted in third-party task killers becoming popular on the Google Play store where users mistakenly believe that they are required to manage apps and RAM themselves similar to on a desktop operating system such as Windows Third-party Android task killers are generally regarded as doing more harm than goo Update schedule Main article Android version history From left to right HTC Dream G1 Nexus One Nexus S Galaxy Nexus Google provides major updates typically incremental in nature to Android every six to nine months which most devices are capable of receiving over the air The latest major update is Android 4.2 Jelly Bean Compared to rival mobile operating systems namely iOS Android updates are typically very slow in reaching devices often taking several months from the official Google release date to actually being distributed to device This is caused partly due to the extensive variation in hardware of Android devices for which each update must be tailored as the official Google source code only runs on their flagship Nexus phon Porting Android to specific hardware is a time- and resource-consuming process for device manufacturers who prioritize their newest devices and often leave older ones behin Hence older smartphones are frequently not updated if the manufacturer decides it is not worth their time regardless if the phone is capable of running the updat This problem is compounded when manufacturers customize Android with their own interface and apps which must be reapplied to each new releas Some commentators have noted that manufacturers have a financial incentive not to update their devices as lack of updates for existing devices fuels the purchase of newer one Further delays can be introduced by wireless carriers who after receiving updates from manufacturers customize and brand Android to their needs and conduct extensive testing on their networks before sending the update out to user In 2011 Google partnered with a number of manufacturers and carriers to announce an Android Update Alliance pledging to deliver timely updates for every device for 18 months after its releas As of 2012 this alliance has never been mentioned sinc Open source community Android has an active community of developers and enthusiasts who use the Android source code to develop and distribute their own modified versions of the operating syste These community-developed releases the most widely used of which being CyanogenMod often bring new features and updates to devices faster than through the official manufacturer/carrier channels albeit without as extensive testing or quality assuranc Community releases often come pre- rooted and contain modifications unsuitable for non-technical users such as the ability to overclock or over/undervolt the device s processo Historically the early responses of tablet and smartphone manufacturers and mobile carriers were typically unsupportive of third-party firmware developmen Manufacturers expressed concern about improper functioning of devices running unofficial software and the support costs resulting from thi Moreover modified firmwares such as CyanogenMod sometimes offer features for which carriers would otherwise charge a premium e.g. tethering As a result technical obstacles including locked bootloaders and restricted access to root permissions were common in many device However as community-developed software has grown more popular and following a statement by the Librarian of Congress in the United States that permits the jailbreaking of mobile devices manufacturers and carriers have softened their position regarding third party development with some including HTC Motorola Samsung and Sony Ericsson providing support and encouraging developmen As a result of this over time the need to circumvent hardware restrictions to install unofficial firmware has lessened as an increasing number of devices are shipped with unlocked or unlock able bootloaders similar to the Nexus series of phones although usually requiring that users waive their devices warranties to do s Security and privacy App permissions in the Play Stor See also Mobile security Android applications run in a sandbox an isolated area of the operating system that does not have access to the rest of the system s resources unless access permissions are granted by the user when the application is installe Before installing an application the Play Store displays all required permission A game may need to enable vibration for example but should not need to read messages or access the phoneboo After reviewing these permissions the user can decide whether to install the applicatio The sandboxing and permissions system weakens the impact of vulnerabilities and bugs in applications but developer confusion and limited documentation has resulted in applications routinely requesting unnecessary permissions reducing its effectivenes Several security firms such as Lookout Mobile Security AVG Technologies and McAfee have released antivirus software for Android device This software is ineffective as sandboxing also applies to such applications limiting their ability to scan the deeper system for threat Android smartphones have the ability to report the location of Wi-Fi access points encountered as phone users move around to build databases containing the physical locations of hundreds of millions of such access point These databases form electronic maps to locate smartphones allowing them to run apps like Foursquare Latitude Places and to deliver location-based ad Third party monitoring software such as TaintDroid an academic research-funded project can in some cases detect when personal information is being sent from applications to remote server Licensing The source code for Android is available under free and open source software license Google publishes most of the code including network and telephony stacks under the Apache License version 2.0 and the rest Linux kernel changes under the GNU General Public License version The Open Handset Alliance develops the changes to the Linux kernel in public with source code publicly available at all time The rest of Android is developed in private with source code released publicly when a new version is release Typically Google collaborates with a hardware manufacturer to produce a flagship device part of the Google Nexus series featuring the new version of Android then makes the source code available after that device has been release In early 2011 Google chose to temporarily withhold the Android source code to the tablet-only Honeycomb release the reason according to Andy Rubin in an official Android blog post was because Honeycomb was rushed for production of the Motorola Xoom and they did not want third parties creating a really bad user experience by attempting to put onto smartphones a version of Android intended for tablet The source code was once again made available in November 2011 with the release of Android 4. As Android is not completely released under a GPL compatible license e. Google s code is under the Apache license and also the Android Market allows proprietary softwar Richard Stallman and the FSF have been critical of Android and have recommended the usage of alternatives such as Replicant The Android logotype was designed along with the Droid font family by Ascender Corporation the robot icon was designed by Irina Blo Android Green is the color of the Android Robot that represents the Android operating syste The print color is PMS 376C and the RGB color value in hexadecimal is A4C639 as specified by the Android Brand Guideline The custom typeface

this had grown to 33% of the market becoming the top-selling smartphone platfor This estimate includes the Tapas and OMS variants of Androi By Q3 2011 Gartner estimates more than half 52.5% of the smartphone market belongs to Androi By Q2 2012 according to the research firm IDC Android has a 68% share of the global smartphone marke In February 2010 ComScore said the Android platform had 9.0% of the U. smartphone market as measured by current mobile subscriber This figure was up from an earlier estimate of 5.2% in November 200 By the end of Q3 2010 Android s U. market share had grown to 21.4 In May 2010 Android s first quarter U. sales surpassed that of the rival iPhone platfor According to a report by the NPD group Android achieved 25% smartphone sales in the US market up 8% from the December quarte In the second quarter Apple s iOS was up by 11% indicating that Android is taking market share mainly from RIM and still has to compete with heavy consumer demand for new competitor offering Furthermore analysts pointed to advantages that Android had as a multi-channel multi-carrier O In Q4 2010 Android had 59% of the total installed user base of Apple s iOS in the U. and 46% of the total installed user base of iOS in Europ As of June 2011 [update] Google said that 550,000 new Android devices were being activated every day up from 400,000 per day a month earlier and more than 100 million devices had been activate Android hit 300,000 activations per day back in December 201 By July 14 2011 550,000 Android devices were being activated by Google each day with 4.4% growth per

a May 2012 interview with Eurogamer the developers of Football Manager stated that the ratio of pirated players vs legitimate players was 9 1 for their game Football Manager Handhel Not every developer agreed that piracy rates were an issue for example in July 2012 the developers of the game Wind-up Knight said that piracy levels of their game were only 12% and most of the piracy came from China where people cannot purchase apps from Google Pla In 2010 Google released a tool for validating authorised purchases for use within apps but developers complained that this was insufficient and trivial to crack Google responded that the tool especially its initial release was intended as a sample framework for developers to modify and build upon depending on their needs not as a finished security solutio In 2012 Google released a feature in Android 4.1 that encrypted paid applications so that they would only work on the device on which they were purchased but this feature has been temporarily deactivated due to technical issue Copyrights and patents Further information Oracle Google Both Android and Android phone manufacturers have been the target of numerous patent lawsuit On August 12 2010 Oracle sued Google over claimed infringement of copyrights and patents related to the Java programming languag Oracle originally sought damages up to $6.1 billion but this valuation was rejected by a federal judge who asked Oracle to revise the estimat In response Google submitted multiple lines of defense counterclaiming that Android did not infringe on Oracle s patents or copyright that Oracle s patents were invalid and several other defense They said that Android is based on Apache Harmony a clean room implementation of the Java class libraries and an independently developed virtual machine called Dalvik In May 2012 the jury in this case found that Google did not infringe on Oracle s patents and the trial judge ruled that the structure of the Java APIs used by Google was not copyrightabl In addition to lawsuits against Google directly various proxy wars have been waged against Android indirectly by targeting manufacturers of Android devices with the effect of discouraging manufacturers from adopting the platform by increasing the costs of bringing an Android device to marke Both Apple and Microsoft have sued several manufacturers for patent infringement with Apple s ongoing legal action against Samsung being a particularly high-profile cas In October 2011 Microsoft said they had signed patent license agreements with ten Android device manufacturers whose products account for 55% of the worldwide revenue for Android device These include Samsung and HTC Samsung s patent settlement with Microsoft includes an agreement that Samsung will allocate more resources to developing and marketing phones running Microsoft s Windows Phone operating syste Google has publicly expressed its dislike for the current patent landscape in the United States accusing Apple Oracle and Microsoft of trying to take down Android through patent litigation rather than innovating and competing with better products and service In 2011-2 Google purchased Motorola Mobility for US$ 12.5 billion which was viewed in part as a defensive measure to protect Android since Motorola Mobility held more than 17,000 patent In December 2011 Google bought over a thousand patents from IBM Beyond smartphones and tablets While Android is designed primarily for smartphones and tablets the open and customizable nature of the operating system allows it to be used on other electronics including laptops and netbooks smartbooks ebook readers and smart TVs Google TV Further the OS has seen niche applications on wristwatches headphones car CD and DVD players smart glasses
