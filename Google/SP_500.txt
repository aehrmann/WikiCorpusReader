stock market index was the SP90 a value-weighted index based on 90stock StandardPoor s also published a weekly index of 423 companie The SP500 index in its present form began on March4,195 Technology has allowed the index to be calculated and disseminated in real tim The SP500 is widely employed as a measure of the general level of stock prices as it includes both growth stocks and the generally less volatile value stocks The index reached an all-time intraday high which was not exceeded for over seven years of 1,552.87 in trading on March24,2000 during the dot-com bubble and then lost approximately 50% of its value in a two-year bear market spiking below 800points in July2002 and reaching a low of 768.63 intraday on October10,2002 during the stock market downturn of 2002 The SP500 remained below its year-2000 all-time high somewhat longer than the popular Dow Jones Industrial Average and the more comprehensive Wilshire5000 However on May30,2007 the SP500 closed at 1,530.23 to set its first all-time closing high in more than seven year The highest point reached was 1,565.15 on October9,200 In mid-2007 difficulties stemming from subprime mortgage lending began spreading to the wider financial sector resulting in the second bear market of the 21stcentur The resulting crisis became acute in September2008 ushering in a period of unusual volatility encompassing record 100-pointmoves in both directions and reaching the highest levels since 192 On November202008 the index closed at 752.44 its lowest since early199 A modest recovery the following day still left the index down 45.5% for the yea This year-to-date loss was the greatest since1931 when the broad market declined more than 50% the total losses that ushered in the GreatDepression exceeded 80% over a three-year perio The market continued to decline between late2008 and early2009 surrounding the events involving the financial crisis of 2008 reaching a nearly 13-year closing low at 676.53 on March9 200 Subsequently the index recovered sharply with Federal Reserve quantitative easing QE to close at 1,206.07 on December1,2010 up over 78% from the low but still down by more than 23% from the 2007 high this respite has been alternately characterized as heralding a return to economic growth or a significant counter-trend bear market rally After a sharp summer correction of an early 150-point gain in 2011 the SP500 closed above 1,400 on March15,2012 at 1,402.60 and after again correcting about 10% reached its highest levels since December 2007 with the announcement of QE3 on September13,2012 closing at 1,459.99 after this the index peaked at 1,474.51 intraday on September 14.This was the highest peak since December 31 2007 Selection The components of the SP500 are selected by committe This is similar to the Dow 30 but different from others such as the Russell1000 which are strictly rules-base The index does include a handful 15 as of May8,2012 of non-U.S.companie This group includes both formerly U.S.companies that have reincorporated outside the United States as well as firms that have never been incorporated in the United State The committee selects the companies in the SP500 so they are representative of the industries in the United States econom In addition companies that do not have common stock that trades publicly such as limited partnerships and companies that are privately or mutually held and stocks that do not have sufficient liquidity are not in the inde By contrast the Fortune500 attempts to list the 500largest public companies in the United States by gross revenue regardless of whether their stocks trade or their liquidity without adjustment for industry representation and excluding companies incorporated outside the United State Components Main article List of SP 500 companies Versions The SP500 generally quoted is a price return index there are also total return and net total return versions of the inde These versions differ in how dividends are accounted fo The price return version does not account for dividends it only captures the changes in the prices of the index component The total return version reflects the effects of dividend reinvestmen Finally the net total return version reflects the effects of dividend reinvestment after the deduction of withholding tax Weighting This section does not cite any references or sources March 2011 The index has traditionally been market-value weighted that is movements in the prices of stocks with higher market capitalizations the share price times the number of shares outstanding have a greater effect on the index than companies with smaller market cap The index is now float weighted That is StandardPoor s now calculates the market caps relevant to the index using only the number of shares called float available for public tradin This transition was made in two steps the first on March18,2005 and the second on September 16 200 Index maintenance In order to keep the SP500Index comparable across time the index needs to take into account corporate actions such as stock splits share issuance dividends and restructuring events such as mergers or spinoff Additionally in order to keep the Index reflective of American stocks the constituent stocks need to be changed from time to tim To prevent the value of the Index from changing merely as a result of corporate financial actions all such actions affecting the market value of the Index require a Divisor adjustmen Also when a company is dropped and replaced by another with a different market capitalization the divisor needs to be adjusted in such a way that the value of the SP500 Index remains constan All Divisor adjustments are made after the close of trading and after the calculation of the closing value of the SP500Inde Type of Action Divisor Adjustment Stock Split e. 2x1 No Share Issuance Yes Share Repurchase Yes Special Cash Dividend Yes Company Change Yes Rights offering Yes Spinoffs Yes Mergers Yes Update frequency The index value is updated every 15 seconds during trading session Investing Many index funds and exchange-traded funds attempt to replicate before fees and expenses the performance of the SP500 by holding the same stocks as the index in the same proportion Many other mutual funds are benchmarked to the SP50 Consequently a company whose stock is added to the list of SP500 stocks may see its stock price rise as the managers of index funds normally choose to purchase that company s stock in order to continue tracking the SP 500 inde Some examples include Vanguard s SP 500 Index Fund VOO iShares SP 500 ETF IVV and SPDR s SP 500 ETF SPY Several mutual fund managers also provide index funds that track the SP500 the first of which was The Vanguard Group s Vanguard500 in 197 Many retirement plans offer such fund For example the Thrift Savings Plan s C Fund tracks the total return SP 500 inde In addition to investing in

871million shares with a closing price of $88.50 the monetary value of traded shares which changed hands exceeded an astounding $77billion for the da BlackRock offers the iShares SP500 NYSE IVV which
