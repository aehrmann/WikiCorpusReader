unprecedented wealth and some were eager to found institutions in their names as part of philanthropy campaigns using portions of their vast wealt Washington Duke at Duke University Ezra Cornell at Cornell University Johns Hopkins at Johns Hopkins University Leland Stanford at Stanford University John Rockefeller at the University of Chicago and Cornelius Vanderbilt at Vanderbilt University are several notable examples of Andrew Carnegie s gospel of wealth mentality and Carnegie Mellon University is one such resul Carnegie Mellon predecessor institution Carnegie Technical Schools was founded in 1900 in Pittsburgh by the Scottish American industrialist and philanthropist Andrew Carnegie who wrote the time-honored words My heart is in the work when he donated the funds to create the institutio Carnegie s vision was to open a vocational training school for the sons and daughters of working-class Pittsburghers Many of whom worked in his mills The campus began to take shape in the Beaux-Arts architecture style of Henry Hornbostel winner of the 1904 competition to design the original institution and later the founder of what is now the Carnegie Mellon School of Architecture The name was changed to the Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1912 and the school began offering four-year degree In 1965 it merged with Andrew Mellon s Mellon Institute of Industrial Research to become Carnegie Mellon Universit In addition Carnegie founded Carnegie Mellon s coordinate women s college Margaret Morrison Carnegie College in 1903 which closed in 1973 Andrew Mellon founder of the Mellon Institute There was little change to the campus between the first and second World War A 1938 master plan by Githens and Keally suggested acquisition of new land along Forbes Avenue but the plan was not fully implemente The period starting with the construction of the Graduate School of Industrial Administration building 1952 and ending with Wean Hall 1971 saw the institutional change from Carnegie Institute of Technology to Carnegie Mellon Universit New facilities were needed to respond to the University s growing national reputation in artificial intelligence business robotics and the art In addition an expanding student population resulted in a need for improved facilities for student life athletics and librarie The campus finally expanded to Forbes Avenue from its original land along Schenley Park A ravine long known as the cut was gradually filled in to campus level joining the Mall as a major campus open spac Hamerschlag and Roberts Halls are two of the teaching facilities of the College of Engineering The buildings of this era reflect current attitudes toward architectural styl The International Style with its rejection of historical tradition and its emphases on functionalism and expression of structure had been in vogue in urban settings since the 1930 It came late to the Carnegie campus because of the hiatus in building activity and a general reluctance among all institutions of higher education to abandon historical style By the 1960s it was seen as a way to accomplish the needed expansion and at the same time give the campus a new imag Each building was a unique architectural statement that may have acknowledged the existing campus in its placement but not in its form or material During the 1970s and 1980s the tenure of University President Richard Cyert 19721990 witnessed a period of unparalleled growth and developmen The research budget soared from roughly US$12 million annually in the early 1970s to more than US$110 million in the late 1980 The work of researchers in new fields like robotics and software engineering helped the university build on its reputation for innovation and practical problem solvin President Cyert stressed strategic planning and comparative advantage pursuing opportunities in areas where Carnegie Mellon could outdistance its competitor One example of this approach was the introduction of the university s Andrew computing network in the mid-1980 This pioneering project which linked all computers and workstations on campus set the standard for educational computing and established Carnegie Mellon as a leader in the use of technology in education and researc On April 24 1984 cmu.edu Carnegie Mellon s Internet domain became among the first six edu URLs Present Wean Hall home of the world

meeting plac The students did not understand why anyone would want to meet at a fenc Administration was about to give up and tear it down but that night a fraternity as a prank painted the entire fence advertising a fraternity part Ever since painting the Fence has been a Carnegie Mellon traditio The Fence at Carnegie Mellon lies at the center of campus in the area known as the cu Students guard the fence 24 hours a day and as long as two vigils are maintained no other student may take the fenc The fence can then be painted by the group that has it but only between midnight and 6 a Only hand brushes may be used the use of spray paint or paint rollers is considered vandalism and results in a fin The previous paint cannot be stripped and each new painting adds a new laye The original wooden fence finally collapsed in the 1990s due to the weight from over 1 of surrounding paint and was immediately replaced with an identical one manufactured from concret Today the fence is considered the world s most painted object by the Guinness Book of World Record Spring Carnival - Usually held in April Spring Carnival is the biggest event of the school yea In addition to classic

with five runners using the buggy vehicle as the bato Entrants submit a small usually torpedo-shaped vehicle that is pushed uphill and then allowed to roll downhil The vehicles are unpowered including the prohibition of such energy-storing devices as flywheel They are however steered by a driver who is usually a petite female student lying prone arms stretched forward to steer via a turning mechanis Space is so tight inside the buggies that the drivers usually cannot change position beyond turning their head A Mobot competing in the annual Mobot challenge Mobot - Mobot a portmanteau for mobile robot is an annual competition at Carnegie Mellon that made its debut in 199 In this event robots try autonomously to pass through gates in order and reach the finish lin There is a white line
