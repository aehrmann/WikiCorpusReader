Celtic British place name Eidyn mentioned in a number of medieval Welsh source 297 Kenneth Jackson argued strongly that Eidyn referred exclusively to the location of modern Edinburgh but others such as Ifor Williams and Nora Chadwick suggest it applied to the wider area as wel The name Eidyn may survive today in other toponyms such as Dunedin and Carriden from Caer Eidyn located fifteen miles to the wes Edinburgh Castle Present-day Edinburgh was the location of Din Eidyn a dun or hillfort associated with the kingdom of the Gododdin The modern Scottish Gaelic name Dn Eideann derives directly from the British Din Eidyn the English and Scots form are similar adding the element - burgh from the Old English burh also meaning for Some sources claim Edinburgh s name is derived from an Old English form such as Eadwinesburh in reference to the 7th century king Edwin of Northumbria However modern scholarship refutes this as the form Eidyn predates Edwi The first evidence of the existence of the town as a separate entity from the fort lies in an early 12th century royal charter generally thought to date from 1124 by King David I granting land to the Church of the Holy Rood of Edinburg This suggests that the town came into official existence between 1018 when King Malcolm II secured the Lothians from the Northumbrians and 112 By the 1170s King William the Lion was using the name Edenesburch in a charter in Latin confirming the 1124 grant of David History Further information Timeline of Edinburgh history Humans have settled the Edinburgh area from at least the Bronze Age leaving traces of primitive stone settlements at Holyrood Craiglockhart Hill and the Pentland Hills for exampl Local culture was influenced through the Iron Age by Hallstatt and La Tene Celtic cultures from central Europ By the time the Romans arrived in Lothian at the beginning of the 1st millennium AD they discovered a Celtic Brythonic tribe whose name they recorded as Votadini likely to be a Latin version of the name they called themselve The Angles of Northumbria had a significant influence in what was to become South-East Scotland notably from AD 638 when it appears the Gododdin stronghold was besiege Though far from exclusive cf Picts and Scots this influence continued over three centurie It was not until AD 950 when during the reign of Indulf son of Constantine II the city referred to at this time in the Pictish Chronicle as oppidum Eden fell to the Scots and finally remained under their jurisdictio During this period of Germanic influence in south east Scotland when the city s name gained its Germanic suffix burgh the seeds for the language we know today as Scots were sow By the 12th century Edinburgh founded upon the famous castle rock the volcanic crag and tail

King James VI progressed to London establishing there his court from which he reigned over his kingdom Despite promising to return every three years he returned to Edinburgh only once in 161 Disputes between the Presbyterian Covenanters and the Anglican Church in 1639 led to the Bishops Wars the initial conflict of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms During the Third English Civil War Edinburgh was

into the Kingdom of Great Britain As a consequence the Parliament of Scotland merged with the Parliament of England to form the Parliament of Great Britain which sat at Westminster in Londo The union

many ways including on seal In 1732 the achievement or coat of arms was formally granted by the Lord Lyon King of Arms These arms were used by Edinburgh Town Council until the reorganisation of local government in Scotland in May 1975 when it was succeeded by the City of Edinburgh District Council and a new coat of arms based on the earlier one was grante In 1996 further local government reorganisation resulted in the formation of the City of Edinburgh Council and again the coat of arms was update During the Jacobite rising of 1745 Edinburgh was briefly occupied by Jacobite forces

Celebrities from across the continent would be seen in the city streets among them famous Scots such as David Hume Walter Scott Robert Adam David Wilkie Robert Burns James Hutton and Adam Smith Edinburgh became a major cultural centre earning it the nickname Athens of the North because of the Greco-Roman style of the New Town s architecture as well as the rise of the Scottish intellectual elite who were increasingly leading both Scottish and European intellectual though In the 19th century Edinburgh like many cities industrialised but did not grow as fast as Scotland s second city Glasgow which replaced it as the largest city in the country benefiting greatly at the height of the British Empire The Scotland Act 1998 which came into force in 1999 established a devolved Scottish

Westminster Geography Further information Geography of Edinburgh Arthur s Seat viewed across southern parts of Edinburgh from Blackford Hill The view from Arthur s Seat west over the Salisbury Crags and Edinburgh Bounded by the Firth of Forth to the north and the Pentland Hills which skirt the periphery of the city to the south Edinburgh lies in the eastern portion of the Central Lowlands of Scotlan The city sprawls over a landscape which is the product of early volcanic activity and later periods of intensive glaciatio Igneous activity between 350 and 400 million years ago coupled with faulting led to the dispersion of tough basalt volcanic plugs which predominate over much of the are One such example is Castle Rock which forced the advancing icepack to divide sheltering the softer rock and forming a mile-long tail of material to the east creating a distinctive crag and tail formatio Glacial erosion on the northern side of the crag gouged a large valley resulting in the now drained Nor Loch This structure along with a ravine to the south formed an ideal natural fortress which Edinburgh Castle was built upo Similarly Arthur s Seat is the remains of a volcano system dating from the Carboniferous period which was eroded by a glacier moving from west to east during the ice ag Erosive action such as plucking and abrasion exposed the rocky crags to the west before leaving a tail of deposited glacial material swept to the eas This process formed the distinctive Salisbury Crags which formed a series of teschenite cliffs located between Arthur s Seat and the city centr The residential areas of Marchmont and Bruntsfield are built along a series of drumlin ridges located south of the city centre which were deposited as the glacier recede Other viewpoints in the city such as Calton Hill and Corstorphine Hill are similar products of glacial erosio The Braid Hills and Blackford Hill are a series of small summits to the south west of the city commanding expansive views

18mi through the south and west of the city emptying into the Firth of Forth at Leith The nearest the river gets to the city centre is at Dean Village on the edge of the New Town where a deep gorge is spanned by the Dean Bridge designed by Thomas Telford and built in 1832 for the road to Queensferry The Water of Leith Walkway is a mixed use trail that follows the river for 19.6 kilometres 12.2mi from Balerno to Leit The Water of Leith at Juniper Green Designated in 1957 Edinburgh is ringed by a green belt stretching from Dalmeny in the west to Prestongrange in the eas With an average width of 3.2 kilometres 2mi the principal objective of the green belt was to contain the outward expansion of Edinburgh and to prevent the agglomeration of urban area Expansion within the green belt is strictly controlled but developments such as Edinburgh Airport and the Royal Highland Showground at Ingliston are located within the zon Similarly urban villages such as Juniper Green and Balerno sit on green belt lan One feature of the green belt in Edinburgh is the inclusion of parcels of land within the city which are designated as green belt even though they do not adjoin the main peripheral
