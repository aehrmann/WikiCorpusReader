GNOME 3.x desktop environment Latest version of KDE using Plasma as the deskto Xfce 4.x desktop environment In graphical computing a desktop environment DE commonly refers to a particular implementation of graphical user interface GUI derived from the desktop metaphor that is seen on most modern personal computers These GUIs help the user in easily accessing configuring and modifying many important and frequently accessed specific operating system OS feature The GUI usually does not afford access to all the many features found in an O Instead the traditional command-line interface CLI is still used when full control over the OS is required in such case A desktop environment typically consists of icons windows toolbars folders wallpapers and desktop widgets see Elements of graphical user interfaces and WIMP A GUI might also provide drag and drop functionality and other features that make the desktop metaphor more complet A desktop environment aims to be an intuitive way for the user to interact with the computer using concepts which are similar to those used when interacting with the physical world such as buttons and window While the term desktop environment originally described a style of user interfaces following the desktop metaphor it has also come to describe the programs that realize the metaphor itsel This usage has been popularized by the Common Desktop Environment and the K Desktop Environment 1 Implementation 2 History and common use 3 Desktop environments for the X Window System 4 Examples of desktop environments 4.1 Gallery 5 References Implementation On a system that offers a desktop environment a window manager in conjunction with applications written using a widget toolkit are generally responsible for most of what the user see The window manager supports the user interactions with the environment while the toolkit provides developers a software library for applications with a unified look and behavio A windowing system of some sort generally interfaces directly with the underlying operating system and librarie This provides support for graphical hardware pointing devices and keyboard The window manager generally runs on top of this windowing syste While the windowing system may provide some window management functionality this functionality is still considered to be part of the window manager which simply happens to have been provided by the windowing syste Applications that are created with a particular window manager in mind usually make use of a windowing toolkit generally provided with the operating system or window manage A windowing toolkit gives applications access to widgets that allow the user to interact graphically with the application in a consistent wa History and common use Further information History of the graphical user interface The first desktop environment was by Xerox and was sold with the Xerox Alto in the 1970 The Alto was generally considered by Xerox to be a personal office computer it failed in the marketplace because of poor marketing and a very high price ta With the Lisa Apple introduced a desktop environment on an affordable personal computer which also failed in the marke On commercial personal computers the desktop metaphor was popularized among technical users by the original Macintosh from Apple in 1984 and among the general population by Windows 95 from Microsoft in 199 As of 2011 [update] the most popular desktop environments are their updated versions in Windows XP and Windows 7 followed by the desktop environment of Mac OS X When compared with desktop environments for Linux the ones included with these operating systems are relatively unalterabl Although with the exception of Macs which are shipped with Mac OS X personal computers using Linux and other Unix-like OSs are still much less common in recent years there has been a growing market for low cost Linux PCs that use the X Window System These machines support many X11-based desktop environment Desktop environments for the X Window System On systems running the X Window System typically Unix-like systems such as Linux the desktop environment is much more flexibl In this context a desktop environment typically consists of a window manager such as Metacity or KWin a file manager such as Nautilus or Dolphin a set of themes and programs and libraries for managing the deskto All of these individual modules can be exchanged and individually configured to achieve a unique combination but most desktop environments provide a default configuration that requires minimal user inpu Some window managers such as IceWM Fluxbox and Window Maker contain rudimentary desktop environment elements while others like evilwm and wmii do no Not all of the program code that is part of a desktop environment has effects which are directly visible to the use Some of it may be low-level cod KDE for example provides so-called KIO slaves which give the user access to a wide range of virtual device These I/O slaves are not available outside the KDE environmen Initially CDE was available as a proprietary solution but was never popular on Linux systems due to cost and licensing restriction [ citation needed ] In 1996 the KDE was announced followed in 1997 by the announcement of GNOME Xfce is a smaller project that was also founded in 1997 and focuses on speed and modularity just like LXDE which was started in 200 A comparison of X Window System desktop environments demonstrates the differences between environment Today GNOME and KDE are the dominant solutions and these are often installed by default on GNU/Linux system Each of them offers To programmers a set of standard APIs a programming environment and human interface guidelines To translators a collaboration infrastructur KDE and GNOME are available in many language To artists a workspace to share their talent To ergonomics specialists the chance to help simplify the working environmen To developers of third-party applications a reference environment for integratio OpenOffice.org is one such applicatio To users a complete desktop environment and a suite of essential application These include a file manager web browser multimedia player email client address book PDF reader photo manager and system preferences applicatio In the early 2000s KDE reached maturity along with GNOM [ citation needed ] Still active the Appeal and ToPaZ projects focus on bringing new advances to the next major releases of both KDE and GNOME respectivel Although striving for broadly similar goals GNOME and KDE do differ in their approach to user ergonomic KDE encourages applications to integrate and interoperate is highly customizable and contains many complex features all whilst trying to establish sensible default GNOME on the other hand is more prescriptive and focuses on the finer details of essential tasks and overall simplificatio Accordingly each one attracts a different user and developer communit Technically there are numerous technologies common to all Linux desktop environments most obviously the X Window System Accordingly the freedesktop.org project was established as an informal collaboration zone with the goal being to reduce duplication of effor As GNOME and KDE focus on high-performance computers those users with old slow hardware often use alternative desktop environments specifically created for low-performance system The two most common lightweight desktop environments are LXDE and Xfc Both use GTK+ the same underlying toolkit as GNOM Razor-Qt is also considered a fast desktop environment because it is based on Qt technologies the same underlying toolkit as KD While still a new project Razor-Qt already contains the key DE component Examples of desktop environments The most common desktop environment on personal computers is Microsoft Windows built-in interfac It is titled Luna in Windows XP and Aero in Windows Vista and Windows 7 Also common is Aqua included with Apple s Mac OS X Mainstream desktop environments for Unix-like operating systems using the X Window System include KDE GNOME Xfce and LXD A number of other desktop environments also exist including but not limited to CDE EDE GEM IRIX Interactive Desktop Sun s Java Desktop System Jesktop Mezzo Project Looking Glass ROX Desktop UDE Xito XFast Moreover there exists FVWM-Crystal which consists of a powerful configuration for the FVWM window manager a theme and further adds altogether forming a construction kit for building up a desktop environmen X window managers that are meant to be usable stand-alonewithout another desktop environmentalso include elements reminiscent of those found in typical desktop environments most prominently Enlightenment [ citation needed ] Other examples include OpenBox Fluxbox WindowLab Fvwm as well as Window Maker and AfterStep which both feature the NeXTSTEP GUI look and fee The Amiga approach to desktop environment was noteworthy the original Workbench desktop environment in AmigaOS evolved through time to originate an entire family of descendants and alternative desktop solution Some of those descendants are the Scalos the Ambient desktop of MorphOS and the Wanderer desktop of the AROS open source O WindowLab also contains features reminiscent of the Amiga U Third party Directory Opus software which was originally just a navigational file manager program then evolved to became to a complete Amiga desktop replacement called Directory Opus Magella There is the Workplace Shell that runs on IBM OS/2 or eComStation The
