designed by Google to work exclusively with web applications Google announced the operating system on July 7 2009 and made it an open source project called Chromium OS in November 200 Unlike Chromium OS which can be compiled from the downloaded source code Chrome OS only ships on specific hardware from Google s manufacturing partner The user interface takes a minimalist approach resembling that of the Google Chrome web browse Since Google Chrome OS is aimed at users who spend most of their computer time on the Web the only application on the device is a browser incorporating a media player and a file manager The launch date for retail hardware featuring Chrome OS slipped after Google first announced the operating system from an initial forecast date in late 2010 to June 15 2011 when Chromebooks from Samsung and then Acer in July actually shippe 1 History 1.1 Cr-48 prototype hardware 1.2 Commercial hardware Chromebooks 1.3 Relationship to Android 2 Design 2.1 User interface 2.1.1

lower power consumption of netbooks and the focus of these small laptops on Internet acces To ascertain marketing requirements for an operating system focused on netbook Web transactions the company did not do the usual demographic research generally associated with a large software development projec Instead engineers relied on more informal metrics including monitoring the usage patterns of some 200 Chrome OS machines used by Google employee Developers also noted their own usage pattern Matthew Papakipos former engineering director for the Chrome OS project put three machines in his house and found himself logging in for brief sessions to make a single search query or send a short emai On November 19 2009 Google released Chrome OS s source code as the Chromium OS projec As with other open source projects developers are modifying code from Chromium OS and building their own versions whereas Google Chrome OS code will only be supported by Google and its partners and will only run on hardware designed for the purpos Unlike Chromium OS Chrome OS will be automatically updated to the latest versio InformationWeek reviewer Serdar Yegulalp wrote that Chrome OS will be a product developed to a level of polish and a degree of integration with its host hardware that Chromium OS does not have by default whereas Chromium OS is a project a common baseline from which the finished work is derived as well as a pool for derivative work The product and project will be developed in parallel and borrow from each othe At a November 19 2009 news conference Sundar Pichai the Google vice president overseeing Chrome demonstrated an early version of the operating syste He previewed a desktop which looked very similar to the Chrome browser and in addition to the regular browser tabs also had application tabs which take less space and can be pinned for easier acces At the conference the operating system booted up in seven seconds a time Google said it would work to reduc Also on November 19 2009 Chris Kenyon vice president of OEM services at Canonical Ltd announced that Canonical is contributing engineering to Google [Chrome OS] under contrac In our discussions Sundar Pichai and Linus Upson made it clear that they want wherever feasible to build on existing components and tools from the open source community without unnecessary re-inventio This clear focus should benefit a wide variety of existing projects and we welcome i On January 25 2010 Google posted notes images and a video of a conceptual design showing how a Chrome OS user interface might look on a tablet computer with a 510inch scree The design would include the same basic layout as on netbooks but with a touch interface an onscreen qwerty keyboard in different layouts large square icons placed above the tabs and panels placed along the bottom edge that could be opened with an upward dragging motio The posting was made two days before Apple announced the iPad table On March 16 2011 several changes to Chromium OS were made which indicate the development of a tablet version of Google Chrome O In March 2010 Google indicated that consideration is being given to developing two versions of the operating system a consumer version and an enterprise versio Cr-48 prototype hardware The Cr-48 showing the setup screen seen when first booting up a Chromebook At a December 7 2010 press briefing Google announced the Cr-48 laptop a reference hardware design to test the Chrome OS operating syste It was named after Chromium-48 an unstable isotope of the metallic element known as Chromiu The laptop s design broke convention by replacing the caps lock key with a dedicated search ke The Cr-48 was intended for testing only not retail sale Google addressed complaints that the operating system offers little functionality when the host device is not connected to the Interne The company demonstrated an offline version of Google Docs running on Chrome OS and announced a 3G plan that would give Chrome OS users 100 MB of free data each month with additional paid plans available from Verizo About 60,000 Cr-48s were distributed to testers and reviewers in early December 201 Reviews of Chrome OS running on the Cr-48 in mid-December 2010 indicated that while the project held promise it still had some distance to go before being ready for marke On March 8 2011 Google Product Management vice president Sundar Pichai stated that the last of the 60,000 Cr-48s had been shippe The Cr-48 notebooks have additional unused hardware components for implementation at a future date including a Bluetooth 2.1 controlle The USB port only acts as a keyboard mouse Ethernet adapter or USB storage port and will not work as a printer port as there is no print stack on the operating syste Adding further hardware outside of the previously mentioned items will likely cause problems with the operating system s self knowing security mode Users are encouraged to use a secure service called Google Cloud Print to print to legacy printers connected to their desktop computers or connect an HP ePrint Kodak Hero Kodak ESP or Epson Connect printer to the Google Cloud Print service for a cloud aware printer connectio Commercial hardware Chromebooks Main article Chromebook Google initially named several development partners working on hardware for the operating system with others named in the press including Acer Adobe Asus Freescale Hewlett-Packard Lenovo Qualcomm Texas Instruments Toshiba Intel Samsung and Dell On May 11 2011 at its Google I/O developer conference Google announced that the first two commercially available laptops incorporating Chrome OS would be manufactured by Acer In and Samsung Electronics Co. with a retail price beginning at $34 The ship date was June 15 for the United States the United Kingdom France Germany Netherlands Italy and Spai The Chromebooks are sold in the United States through Amazon and Best Buy internationally through leading retailers Google claimed an eight-second bootup time and eight-hour operation on one battery charge and said that the chromebooks would require no virus protectio Models equipped with 3G connectivity receive 100 megabytes of wireless data per month free for two years with an additional gigabyte at $20 per mont Samsung created a Chrome OS desktop machine called a Chromebox Google also announced a monthly payment scheme for business and education customers at $28 and $20 per user per month respectively for a three-year contract including replacements and upgrade On May 29 2012 Google and Samsung introduced the Second-Generation Chromebook and a new compact desktop Chromebox which was said to be a clone of the Apple Mac Mini Relationship to Android Google s successive introduction of the popular Android and Google Chrome OS has put the company behind two open source client-based operating system Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer accused Google of not being able to make up its min Google has suggested that the two operating systems address different markets mobile and personal computing which remain distinct despite the growing convergence of the device Google co-founder Sergey Brin suggested that the two systems will likely converge over tim Steven Levy wrote that the dissonance between the two systems was apparent at the 2011 Google I/O developer conferenc Each day of the event featured a keynote devoted to one system followed by a press briefing where each team leader Android s Andy Rubin and Chrome s Sundar Pichai unconvincingly tried to explain why the systems weren t competitiv Co-founder Sergey Brin addressed the question by saying that owning two promising OS s was a problem that most companies would love to face Design Early in the project Google put online many details of Chrome OS s design goals and directio But the company has not followed up with a technical description of the completed operating syste User interface Old Chrome-Chromium OS login screen Design goals for Google Chrome OS s user interface included using minimal screen space by combining applications and standard Web pages into a single tab strip rather than separating the tw Designers considered a reduced window management scheme that would operate only in full-screen mod Secondary tasks would be handled with panels floating windows that dock to the bottom of the screen for tasks like chat and music player Split screens were also under consideration for viewing two pieces of content side-by-sid Google Chrome OS would follow the Chrome browser s practice of leveraging HTML5 s offline modes background processing and notification Designers proposed using search and pinned tabs as a way to quickly locate and access application New window manager and graphics engine On April 10 2012 a new build of Chrome OS offered a choice between the original full-screen window interface and overlapping re-sizable windows such as found on Microsoft Windows and Apple s Mac OS X The feature was implemented through the Ash window manager which runs atop the Aura hardware-accelerated graphics engin The April 2012 upgrade also included the ability to display smaller overlapping browser windows each with its own translucent tabs browser tabs that can be torn and dragged to new positions or merged with another tab strip and a mouse-enabled shortcut list across the bottom of the scree One icon on the task bar shows a list of installed apps and bookmark Writing in CNET Stephen Shankland argued that with overlapping windows Google is anchoring itself into the past as both iOS and Microsoft s Metro interface are largely or entirely full-scree Even so Chrome OS already is different enough that it s best to preserve any familiarity that can be preserved Architecture In preliminary design documents for the Chromium OS open source project Google described a three-tier architecture firmware browser and window manager and system-level software and userland service The firmware contributes to fast boot time by not probing for hardware such as floppy disk drives that are no longer common on computers especially netbook The firmware also contributes to security by verifying each step in the boot process and incorporating system recover System-level software includes the Linux kernel that has been patched to improve boot performanc Userland software has been trimmed to essentials with management by Upstart which can launch services in parallel re-spawn crashed jobs and defer services in the interest of faster bootin The window manager handles user interaction with multiple client windows much like other X window managers Remote application access and virtual desktop access In June 2010 Google software engineer Gary Kamark wrote that Chrome OS will access remote applications through a technology unofficially called Chromoting which would resemble Microsoft s Remote Desktop Connection The name has since been changed to Chrome Remote Desktop and is probably closer to running an application via Remote Desktop Services or by first connecting to a host machine by using RDP or VNC Initial roll-outs of Chrome-OS laptops Chromebooks indicate an interest in enabling users to access virtual desktop Hardware support Google Chrome OS is initially intended for secondary devices like netbooks not as a user s primary PC and will run on hardware incorporating an x86 or ARM -based processo While Chrome OS will support hard disk drives Google has requested that its hardware partners use solid-state drives for performance and reliability reasons as well as the lower capacity requirements inherent in an operating system that accesses applications and most user data on remote server In November 2009 Matthew Papakipos engineering director for the Google Chrome OS claimed that the Chrome OS consumes one-sixtieth as much drive space as Windows 7 Integrated media player file manager Google integrates a media player into both Chrome OS and the Chrome browser enabling users to play back MP3s view JPEGs and handle other multimedia files while offlin Chrome OS also includes an integrated file manager resembling those found on other operating systems with the ability to display folders and their associated files as well as preview and manage file contents using a variety of Web applications including Google Docs and Box.net The file manager in Chrome OS showing a mounted Google Drive Google Drive integration in the file manager was introduced with Aura and Ash in the spring of 201 Printing Google Cloud Print is Google s proposed solution to help any application on any device to print on any printe While the cloud provides virtually any connected device with information access the task of developing and maintaining print subsystems for every combination of hardware and operating system from desktops to netbooks to mobile devices simply isn t feasibl However the cloud service would entail installing a piece of software called a proxy as part of Chrome O The proxy would register the printer with the service manage the print jobs provide the printer driver functionality and give status alerts for each jo Link handling Chrome OS was designed with the intention of having user documents and files stored on online server However both Chrome OS and the Chrome browser have unresolved decisions regarding handling specific file types offlin For example if a JPEG is opened from a local storage device should a specific Web application be automatically opened to view it and if so which one? Similarly if a user clicks on a doc file which website should open Microsoft Office Live Gview or a previewing utility? The project director at that time Matthew Papakipos noted that Windows developers have faced the same fundamental problem Quicktime is fighting with Windows Media Player which is fighting with Chrom As the number of Web applications increases the same problem arise Security In March 2010 Google software security engineer Will Drewry discussed Chrome OS securit Drewry described Chrome OS as a hardened operating system featuring auto-updating and sandbox features that will reduce malware exposur He said that Chrome OS netbooks will be shipped with Trusted Platform Module TPM and include both a trusted bootpath and a physical switch under the battery compartment that actuates a developer mod That mode drops some specialized security functions but increases developer flexibilit Drewry also emphasized that the open source nature of the operating system will contribute greatly to its security by allowing constant developer feedbac At a December 2010 press conference Google claimed that Chrome OS would be the most secure consumer operating system due in part to a verified boot ability in which the initial boot code stored in read-only memory checks for system compromise Shell access Chrome OS includes the Chrome Shell or crosh which offers minimal functionality such as ping and ssh but no Bash -like shell abilitie In developer mode a full-featured Bash shell can be opened via VT -2 and is also accessible via the crosh command shell Reception Early on Chrome OS was viewed as a competitor to Microsoft both directly to Microsoft Windows and indirectly the company s word processing and spreadsheet applicationsthe latter through Chrome OS s reliance on cloud computing But Chrome OS engineering director Matthew Papakipos argued that the two operating systems would not fully overlap in functionality because Chrome OS hosted is intended for netbooks which lack the computational power to run a resource-intensive program like Adobe Photoshop Some observers claimed that other operating systems already fill the niche that Chrome OS is aiming for with the added advantage of supporting native applications in addition to a browse Tony Bradley of PC World wrote in November 2009 We can already do most if not all of what Chrome OS promises to delive Using a Windows 7 or Linux-based netbook users can simply not install anything but a web browser and connect to the vast array of Google products and other web-based services and application Netbooks have been successful at capturing the low-end PC market and they provide a web-centric computing experience toda I am not sure why we should get excited that a year from now we ll be able to do the same thing but locked into doing it from the fourth-place web browse A year later Ryan Paul of Ars Technica came to similar conclusion He wrote that Google s Cr-48 prototype met the basic requirements for Web surfing gaming and personal productivity but falls short for more intensive task He praised Google s approach to security but wondered whether mainstream computer users would accept an operating system whose only application is a browse In its current form I think that the operating system could appeal to some niche audiences like regular consumers users who really just need browsing or office productivity workers at companies that have gone Google or only use intranet app It s decidedly not a full-fledged alternative to the general purpose computing environments that currently ship on netbook Paul wrote that most of Chrome OS s advantages can be found in other software environments without having to sacrifice native application In reviewing the Cr-48 on December 29 2010 Kurt Bakke of Conceivably Tech said in my household the Chromebook has turned into a family appliance and the most frequented computer in our househol Its 15 second startup time and dedicated Google user accounts made it the go-to device for quick searches email as well as YouTube and Facebook activitie It has not turned into a device that can rival the appeal of any of our other notebooks we have one gaming laptop two mainstream notebooks and two netbooks in our household with five kid The biggest complaint I heard was its lack of performance in Flash application In ongoing testing Wolfgang Gruener also writing in Conceivably Tech said that cloud computing at cellular data speeds is unacceptable and that the lack of offline ability turns the Cr-48 into a useless brick when not connecte It s difficult to use the Chromebook as an everyday device and give up what you are used to on a Mac/Windows PC while you surely enjoy the dedicated cloud computing capabilities occasionall He praised a March 2011 update that included new trackpad control features scrolling support power
