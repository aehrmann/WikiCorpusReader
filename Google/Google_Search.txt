Google s rise to success was in large part due to a patented algorithm called PageRank that helps rank web pages that match a given search strin When Google was a Stanford research project it was nicknamed BackRub because the technology checks backlinks to determine a site s importanc Previous keyword-based methods of ranking search results used by many search engines that were once more popular than Google would rank pages by how often the search terms occurred in the page or how strongly associated the search terms were within each resulting pag The PageRank algorithm instead analyzes human-generated links assuming that web pages linked from many important pages are themselves likely to be importan The algorithm computes a recursive score for pages based on the weighted sum of the PageRanks of the pages linking to the PageRank is thought to correlate well with human concepts of importanc In addition to PageRank Google over the years has added many other secret criteria for determining the ranking of pages on result lists reported to be over 250 different indicators the specifics of which are kept secret to keep spammers at bay and help Google maintain an edge over its competitors globall Search results The exact percentage of the total of web pages that Google indexes is not known as it is very difficult to accurately calculat Google presents a two-line summary and also a preview of each search result which includes a link to a cached stored usually older version of the pag Google s cache link in its search results provides a way of retrieving information from websites that have recently gone down and a way of retrieving data more quickly than by clicking the direct lin This feature is still available but many users are not aware of this because it has been moved to the previews of the search results presented next to thes Google not only indexes and caches web pages but also takes snapshots of other file types which include PDF Word documents Excel spreadsheets Flash SWF plain text files and so o Except in the case of text and SWF files the cached version is a conversion to X HTML allowing those without the corresponding viewer application to read the fil Users can customize the search engine by setting a default language using the SafeSearch filtering technology and set the number of results shown on each pag Google has been criticized for placing long-term cookies on users machines to store these preferences a tactic which also enables them to track a user s search terms and retain the data for more than a yea [ citation needed ] For any query up to the first 1000 results can be shown with a maximum of 100 displayed per pag The ability to specify the number of results is available only if Instant Search is not enable If Instant Search is enabled only 10 results are displayed regardless of this settin [ original research? ] In 2012 Google changed its rankings to demote sites that had been accused of piracy excepting the Google-owned YouTube sit Non-indexable data Despite its immense index there is also a considerable amount of data available in online databases which are accessible by means of queries but not by link This so-called invisible or deep Web is minimally covered by Google and other search engine The deep Web contains library catalogs official legislative documents of governments phone books and other content which is dynamically prepared to respond to a quer Google optimization Main article Search engine optimization Since Google is the most popular search engine many webmasters have become eager to influence their website s Google ranking An industry of consultants has arisen to help websites increase their rankings on Google and on other search engine This field called search engine optimization attempts to discern patterns in search engine listings and then develop a methodology for improving rankings to draw more searchers to their client s site Search engine optimization encompasses both on page factors like body copy title elements H1 heading elements and image alt attribute values and Off Page Optimization factors like anchor text and PageRank The general idea is to affect Google s relevance algorithm by incorporating the keywords being targeted in various places on page in particular the title element and the body copy note the higher up in the page presumably the better its keyword prominence and thus the ranking Too many occurrences of the keyword however cause the page to look suspect to Google s spam checking algorithm Google has published guidelines for website owners who would like to raise their rankings when using legitimate optimization consultant It has been hypothesized and allegedly is the opinion of the owner of one business about which there have been numerous complaints that negative publicity for example numerous consumer complaints may serve as well to elevate page rank on Google Search as favorable comment The particular problem addressed in The New York Times article which involved DecorMyEyes was addressed shortly thereafter by an undisclosed fix in the Google algorith According to Google it was not the frequently published consumer complaints about DecorMyEyes which resulted in the high ranking but mentions on news websites of events which affected the firm such as legal actions against i Google Webmaster Tools helps to check for websites that use duplicate or copyright conten Functionality Image of definition link provided for many search term Google search consists of a series of localized website The largest of those the google.com site is the top most-visited website in the worl Some of its features include a definition link for most searches including dictionary words the number of results you got on your search links to other searches e. for words that Google believes to be misspelled it provides a link to the search results using its proposed spelling and many mor Search syntax Google s search engine normally accepts queries as a simple text and breaks up the user s text into a sequence of search terms which will usually be words that are to occur in the results but one can also use Boolean operators such as quotations marks for a phrase a prefix such as + - for qualified terms no longer valid the + was removed from Google on October 19 2011 or one of several advanced operators such as site The webpages of Google Search Basics describe each of these additional queries and options see below Search options Google s Advanced Search web form gives several additional fields which may be used to qualify searches by such criteria as date of first retrieva All advanced queries transform to regular queries usually with additional qualified ter Query expansion Google applies query expansion to the submitted search query transforming it into the query that will actually be used to retrieve result As with page ranking the exact details of the algorithm Google uses are deliberately obscure but certainly the following transformations are among those that occur Term reordering in information retrieval this is a standard technique to reduce the work involved in retrieving result This transformation is invisible to the user since the results ordering uses the original query order to determine relevanc Stemming is used to increase search quality by keeping small syntactic variants of search term There is a limited facility to fix possible misspellings in querie I m Feeling Lucky Google s homepage includes a button labeled I m Feeling Lucky When a user types in a search and clicks on the button the user will be taken directly to the first search result bypassing the search engine results page The thought is that if a user is feeling lucky the search engine will return the perfect match the first time without having to page through the search result However with the introduction of Google Instant it is not possible to use the button properly unless the Google Instant function is switched of According to a study by Tom Chavez of Rapt this feature costs Google $110 million a year as 1% of all searches use this feature and bypass all advertisin Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox used Lucky Search as the default search string when the user entered a query in the location ba This functionality was deprecated in later versions but can be brought back in Mozilla Firefox by setting the keyword.URL string to on the page about confi On October 30 2009 for some users the I m Feeling Lucky button was removed from Google s main page along with the regular search butto Both buttons were replaced with a field that reads This space intentionally left blan This text faded out when the mouse was moved on the page and normal search functionality is achieved by filling in the search field with the desired terms and pressing ente A Google spokesperson explains This is just a test and a way for us to gauge whether our users will like an even simpler search interfac Personalized Google homepages retained both buttons and their normal function On May 21 2010 the 30th anniversary of Pac-Man the I m Feeling Lucky button was replaced with a button reading the words Insert Coin After pressing the button the user would begin a Google-themed game of Pac-Man in the area where the Google logo would normally b Pressing the button a second time would begin a two-player version of the same game that includes M Pacman for player This version can be accessed at www.google.com/pacman as a permanent link to the pag Also in 2012 when the mouse cursor is put over the I m Feeling Lucky button the button changes text varying from I m Feeling Stellar to I m Feeling Artistic and so o When the button is clicked the user is redirected to pages and searches in Google related to that specific topic displaye For example when someone clicks I m Feeling Stellar that person may be redirected to the search about reflection nebulae or transported to the Google Earth Explore section about the Hubble Telescope et Rich Snippets On May 12 2009 Google announced that they would be parsing the hCard hReview and hProduct microformats and using them to populate search result pages with what they called Rich Snippets Special features Besides the main search-engine feature of searching for text Google Search has
