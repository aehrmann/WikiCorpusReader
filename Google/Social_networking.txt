to support social networks via computer-mediated communication were made in many early online services including Usenet ARPANET LISTSERV and bulletin board services BBS Many prototypical features of social networking sites were also present in online services such as America Online Prodigy CompuServe ChatNet and The WELL Early social networking on the World Wide Web began in the form of generalized online communities such as Theglobe.com 1995 Geocities 1994 and Tripod.com 1995 Many of these early communities focused on bringing people together to interact with each other through chat rooms and encouraged users to share personal information and ideas via personal webpages by providing easy-to-use publishing tools and free or inexpensive webspac Some communities - such as Classmates.com - took a different approach by simply having people link to each other via email addresse In the late 1990s user profiles became a central feature of social networking sites allowing users to compile lists of friends and search for other users with similar interest New social networking methods were developed by the end of the 1990s and many sites began to develop more advanced features for users to find and manage friend This newer generation of social networking sites began to flourish with the emergence of SixDegrees.com in 1997 followed by Makeoutclub in 2000 Hub Culture and Friendster in 2002 and soon became part of the Internet mainstrea Friendster was followed by MySpace and LinkedIn a year later and eventually Bebo Attesting to the rapid increase in social networking sites popularity by 2005 it was reported that MySpace was getting more page views than Google Facebook launched in 2004 became the largest social networking site in the world in early 200

Information is particularly suited to gift economy as information is a nonrival good and can be gifted at practically no cos Facebook and other social networking tools are increasingly the object of scholarly researc Scholars in many fields have begun to investigate the impact of social-networking sites investigating how such sites may play into issues of identity privacy social capital youth culture and education Several websites are beginning to tap into the power of the social networking model for philanthropy Such models provide a means for connecting otherwise fragmented industries

The things you share are things that make you look good things which you are happy to tie into your identit Hilary Mason chief data scientist bitly VentureBeat 2012 As the increase in popularity of social networking is on a constant rise new uses for the technology are constantly being observe At the forefront of emerging trends in social networking sites is the concept of real-time web and location-base Real-time allows users to contribute content which is then broadcast as it is being uploaded - the concept is analogous to live radio and television broadcast Twitter set the trend for real-time services wherein users can broadcast to the world what they are doing or what is on their minds within a 140-character limi Facebook followed suit with their Live Feed where users activities are streamed as soon as it happen While Twitter focuses on words Clixtr another real-time service focuses on group photo sharing wherein users can update their photo streams with photos while at an even Facebook however remains the largest photo sharing site - Facebook application and photo aggregator Pixable estimates that Facebook will have 100 billion photos by Summer 201 In April 2012 the image-based social media network Pinterest had become the third largest social network in the United State Companies have begun to merge business technologies and solutions such as cloud computing with social networking concept Instead of connecting individuals based on social interest companies are developing interactive communities that connect individuals based on shared business needs or experience Many provide specialized networking tools and applications that can be accessed via their websites such as LinkedIn Others companies such as Monster.com have been steadily developing a more socialized feel to their career center sites to harness some of the power of social networking site These more business related sites have their own nomenclature for the most part but the most common naming conventions are Vocational Networking Sites or Vocational Media Networks with the former more closely tied to individual networking relationships based on social networking principle Foursquare gained popularity as it allowed for users to check-in to places that they are frequenting at that momen Gowalla is another such service that functions in much the same way that Foursquare does leveraging the GPS in phones to create a location-based user experienc Clixtr though in the real-time space is also a location-based social networking site since events created by users are automatically geotagged and users can view events occurring nearby through the Clixtr iPhone ap Recently Yelp announced its entrance into the location-based social networking space through check-ins with their mobile app whether or not this becomes detrimental to Foursquare or Gowalla is yet to be seen as it is still considered a new space in the Internet technology industr One popular use for this new technology is social networking between businesse Companies have found that social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter are great ways to build their brand imag According to Jody Nimetz author of Marketing Jive there are five major uses for businesses and social media to create brand awareness as an online reputation management tool for recruiting to learn about new technologies and competitors and as a lead generation tool to intercept potential prospect These companies are able to drive traffic to their own online sites while encouraging their consumers and clients to have discussions on how to improve or change products or service Social networks and science One other use that is being discussed is the use of social networks in the science communitie Julia Porter Liebeskind et a have published a study on how new biotechnology firms are using social networking sites to share exchanges in scientific knowledg They state in their study that by sharing information and knowledge with one another they are able to increase both their learning and their flexibility in ways that would not be possible within a self-contained hierarchical organizatio Social networking is allowing scientific groups to expand their knowledge base and share ideas and without these new means of communicating their theories might become isolated and irrelevant Social networks and education The European Southern Observatory uses social networks to engage people in astronomical observation Social networks are also being used by teachers and students as a communication too Because many students are already using a wide range of social networking sites teachers have begun to familiarize themselves with this trend in order to leverage student interest in relation to curriculum conten Some of this includes creating chat-room forums and groups to extend classroom discussion to posting assignments tests and quizzes through to assisting with homework outside of the classroom settin Social network services are also being used to foster teacher-parent communicatio These services make it possible and more convenient for parents to ask questions and voice concerns without having to meet face-to-face with their children s teacher The advent of social networking platforms may also be impacting the way s in which learners engage with technology in genera For a number of years Prensky s 2001 dichotomy between Digital Natives and Digital Immigrants has been considered a relatively accurate representation of the ease with which people of a certain age rangein particular those born before and after 1980use technolog Prensky s theory has been largely disproved however and not least on account of the burgeoning popularity of social networking sites and other metaphors such as White and Le Cornu s Visitors and Residents 2011 are greater currenc The use of online social networks by school libraries is also increasingly prevalent and they are being used to communicate with potential library users as well as extending the services provided by individual school librarie Social networks and their educational uses are of interest to many researcher According to Livingstone and Brake 2010 Social networking sites like much else on the internet represent a moving target for researchers and policy maker Recent trends indicate that 47% of American adults use a social networ A national survey in 2009 found that 73% of online teenagers use SNS which is an increase from 55% three years earlie Lenhart Purcell Smith Zickuhr 2010 Recent studies have shown that social network services provide opportunities within professional education curriculum education and learnin However there are constraints in this are Professional uses within education Professional use of social networking services refers to the employment of a network site to connect with other professionals within a given field of interes SNSs like LinkedIn a social networking website geared towards companies and industry professionals looking to make new business contacts or keep in touch with previous co-workers affiliates and client Other network sites are now being used in this manner Twitter has become [a] mainstay for professional development as well as promotion and online SNSs support both the maintenance of existing social ties and the formation of new connection Much of the early research on online communities assume that individuals using these systems would be connecting with others outside their pre-existing social group or location liberating them to form communities around shared interests as opposed to shared geograph Other researchers have suggested that the professional use of network sites produce social capital For individuals social capital allows a person to draw on resources from other members of the networks to which he or she belong These resources can take the form of useful information personal relationships or the capacity to organize group As well networks within these services also can be established or built by joining special interest groups that others have made or creating one and asking others to joi Curriculum uses within education According to Doering Beach and OBrien a future English curriculum needs to recognize a major shift in how adolescents are communicating with each othe Curriculum uses of social networking services also can include sharing curriculum-related resource Educators tap into user-generated content to find and discuss curriculum-related content for student Responding to the popularity of social networking services among many students teachers are increasingly using social networks to supplement teaching and learning in traditional classroom environments as they can provide new opportunities for enriching existing curriculum through creative authentic and/or flexible non-linear learning experience Some social networks such as English baby! and LiveMocha are explicitly education-focused and couple instructional content with an educational peer environmen The new Web 2.0 technologies built into most social networking services promote conferencing interaction creation research on a global scale enabling educators to share remix and repurpose curriculum resource In short social networking services can become research networks as well as learning networks Learning uses within education Educators and advocates of new digital literacies are confident that social networking encourages the development of transferable technical and social skills of value in formal and informal learnin In a formal learning environment goals or objectives are determined by an outside department or agenc Tweeting instant messaging or blogging enhances student involvemen Students who would not normally participate in class are more apt to partake through social network service Networking allows participants the opportunity for

collaborate with others in real tim Social networking services provide a virtual space for learner James Gee 2004 suggests that affinity spaces instantiate participation collaboration distribution and dispersion of expertise and relatednes Registered users share and search for knowledge which contributes to informal learnin Constraints of social networking services in education In the past social networking services were viewed as a distraction and offered no educational benefi Blocking these social networks was a form of protection for students against wasting time bullying and privacy protectio In an education setting Facebook is seen by many instructors and educators as a frivolous time-wasting distraction from schoolwork and it is not uncommon to have Facebook banned at junior high or high school computer lab Cyberbullying has become an issue of concern with social networking service According to the UK Children Go Online survey of 9-19 year olds found that a third have received bullying comments onlin To avoid this problem many school districts/boards have blocked access to social networking services like Facebook MySpace Twitter and so on within the school environmen Social networking services often include a lot of personal information posted publicly and many believe that sharing personal information is a window into privacy thef Schools have taken action to protect students from thi It is believed that this outpouring of identifiable information and the easy communication vehicle that social networking services opens the door to sexual predators cyberbullying and cyberstalking However there is evidence to contradict thi 69% of social media using teens and 85% of adults believe that people are mostly kind to one another on social network sites Recent research suggests that there has been a shift in blocking the use of social networking service In many cases the opposite is occurring as the potential of online networking services is being realize It has been suggested that if schools block them [social networking services] theyre preventing students from learning the skills they nee Banning social networking [] is not only inappropriate but also borderline irresponsible when it comes to providing the best educational experiences for student Schools and school districts have the option of educating safe media usage as well as incorporating digital media into the classroom experience thus preparing students for the literacy they will encounter in the futur Social networks and grassroots organizing Social networks are being used by activists as a means of low-cost grassroots organizin Extensive use of an array of social networking sites enabled organizers of the 2009 National Equality March to mobilize an estimated 200,000 participants to march on Washington with a cost savings of up to 85% per participant over previous method The August 2011 England riots were similarly considered to have escalated and been fuelled by this type of grassroots organizatio Social networks and employment A final rise in social network use is being driven by college students using the services to network with professionals for internship and job opportunitie Many studies have been done on the effectiveness of networking online in a college setting and one notable one is by Phipps Arabie and Yoram Wind published in Advances in Social Network Analysis Many schools have implemented online alumni directories which serve as makeshift social networks that current and former students can turn to for career advic However these alumni directories tend to suffer from an oversupply of advice-seekers and an undersupply of advice provider One new social networking service Ask-a-peer aims to solve this problem by enabling advice seekers to offer modest compensation to advisers for their tim Social network hosting service A social network hosting service is a web hosting service that specifically hosts the user creation of web-based social networking services alongside related application Such services are also known as vertical social networks due to the creation of SNSes that cater to specific user interests and niches like larger interest-agnostic SNSes such niche networking services may also possess the ability to create increasingly niche groups of user An example for this is Nin Business model Few social networks currently charge money for membershi In part this may be because social networking is a relatively new service and the value of using them has not been firmly established in customers mind [ citation needed ] Companies such as MySpace and Facebook sell online advertising on their sit Their business model is based upon large membership count and charging for membership would be counterproductiv Some believe that the deeper information that the sites have on each user will allow much better targeted advertising than any other site can currently provid Social networks operate under an autonomous business model in which a social network s members serve dual roles as both the suppliers and the consumers of conten This is in contrast to a traditional business model where the suppliers and consumers are distinct agent Revenue is typically gained in the autonomous business model via advertisements but subscription-based revenue is possible when membership and content levels are sufficiently hig Social Interaction Put simply social networking is a way for one person to meet up with other people on the ne People use social networking sites for meeting new friends finding old friends or locating people who have the same problems or interests they have called niche networkin More and more relationships and friendships are being formed online and then carried to an offline settin Psychologist and University of Hamburg professor Erich Witte says that relationships which start online are much more likely to succee Witte has said that in less than 10 years online dating will be the predominant way for people to start a relationshi One online dating site claims that 2% of all marriages begin at its site the equivalent of 236 marriages a da Other sites claim 1 in 5 relationships begin onlin Social networking sites play a vital role in this area as wel Being able to meet someone as a friend and see what common interests you share and how you have built up your friend base and likes you can truly see a fuller picture of the person you are talking wit Most sites are free instead of being pay based which allows younger people with stricter budgets to enjoy some of the same features as those of adults who are more likely to be able to afford pay based site While not the intended or original use for these social sites a large area of their current function has stemmed from people wanting to meet other people in person and with the extremely busy schedules of most people it is a fast reliable and easy way in which to do so that costs you little time and money if any Users do not necessarily share with others the content which is of most interest to them but rather that which projects a good impression of themselve New trends in social networking Nextdoor is a new private social networking site aimed at neighborhoods to help strength and enhance social tie This SNS will help to bring together communities since neighbors drifted away because of the digital er More and more Americans are using social networking sites as their primary sources for informatio The percentage of those who have used social networking sites to find new has increased and nearly doubled from 9% to 19% since 201 This percentage is higher than those who get their news from other social media sites new blogs and news podcast Issues Privacy Privacy concerns with social networking services have been raised growing concerns amongst users on the dangers of giving out too much personal information and the threat of sexual predators Users of these services also need to be aware of data theft or viruses However large services such as MySpace and Netlog often work with law enforcement to try to prevent such incident [ citation needed ] In addition there is a perceived privacy threat in relation to placing too much personal information in the hands of large corporations or governmental bodies allowing a profile to be produced on an individual s behavior on which decisions detrimental to an individual may be take Furthermore there is an issue over the control of datainformation that was altered or removed by the user may in fact be retained and/or passed to third partie This danger was highlighted when the controversial social networking site Quechup harvested e-mail addresses from users e-mail accounts for use in a spamming operatio In medical and scientific research asking subjects for information about their behaviors is normally strictly scrutinized by institutional review boards for example to ensure that adolescents and their parents have informed consent It is not clear whether the same rules apply to researchers who collect data from social networking site These sites often contain a great deal of data that is hard to obtain via traditional mean Even though the data are public republishing it in a research paper might be considered invasion of privacy Privacy on social networking sites can be undermined by many factor For example users may disclose personal information sites may not take adequate steps to protect user privacy and third parties frequently use information posted on social networks for a variety of purpose For the Net generation social networking sites have become the preferred forum for social interactions from posturing and role playing to simply sounding of However because such forums are relatively easy to access posted content can be reviewed by anyone with an interest in the users personal information Following plans by the UK government to monitor traffic on social networks schemes similar to E-mail jamming have been proposed for networks such as Twitter and Faceboo These would involve friending and following large numbers of random people to thwart attempts at network analysi Data mining Through data mining companies are able to improve their sales and profitabilit With this data companies create customer profiles that contain customer demographics and online behavio A recent strategy has been the purchase and production of network analysis softwar This software is able to sort out through the influx of social networking data for any specific compan Facebook has been especially important to marketing strategist Facebooks controversial and new Social Ads program gives companies access to the millions of profiles in order to tailor their ads to a Facebook users own interests and hobbie However rather than sell actual user information Facebook sells tracked social action That is they track the websites a user uses outside of Facebook through a program called Facebook Beacon Notifications on websites There has been a trend for social networking sites to send out only positive notifications to user For example sites such as Bebo Facebook and Myspace will not send notifications to users when they are removed from a person s friends lis Likewise Bebo will send out a notification if a user is moved to the top of another user s friends list but no notification is sent if they are moved down the lis This allows users to purge undesirables from their list extremely easily and often without confrontation since a user will rarely notice if one person disappears from their friends lis It also enforces the general positive atmosphere of the website without drawing attention to unpleasant happenings such as friends falling out rejection and failed relationship Access to information Many social networking services such as Facebook provide the user with a choice of who can view their profil This prevents unauthorized user s from accessing their informatio Parents who want to access their child s MySpace or Facebook account have become a big problem for teenagers who do not want their profile seen by their parent By making their profile private teens can select who may see their page allowing only people added as friends to view their profile and preventing unwanted viewing of the profile by parent Most teens are constantly trying to create a structural barrier between their private life and their parent To edit information on a certain social networking service account the social networking sites require you to login or provide a password This prevents unauthorized user s from adding changing or removing personal information pictures and/or other dat See also Unauthorized
