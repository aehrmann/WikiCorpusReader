The Chevrolet Volt is the world s top selling plug-in electric hybrid ca A plug-in hybrid electric vehicle PHEV plug-in hybrid vehicle PHV or plug-in hybrid is a hybrid vehicle which utilizes rechargeable batteries or another energy storage device that can be restored to full charge by connecting a plug to an external electric power source usually a normal electric wall socket A PHEV shares the characteristics of both a conventional hybrid electric vehicle having an electric motor and an internal combustion engine ICE and of an all-electric vehicle having a plug to connect to the electrical grid Most PHEVs on the road today are passenger cars but there are also PHEV versions of commercial vehicles and vans utility trucks buses trains motorcycles scooters and military vehicle The cost for electricity to power plug-in hybrids for all-electric operation has been estimated at less than one quarter of the cost of gasoline in California Compared to conventional vehicles PHEVs reduce air pollution locally and dependence on petroleum PHEVs may reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming compared with conventional vehicle PHEVs also eliminate the problem of range anxiety associated to all-electric vehicles because the combustion engine works as a backup when the batteries are depleted giving PHEVs driving range comparable to other vehicles with gasoline tank Plug-in hybrids use no fossil fuel during their all-electric range and produce lower greenhouse gas emissions if their batteries are charged from renewable electricity Other benefits include improved national energy security fewer fill-ups at the filling station the convenience of home recharging opportunities to provide emergency backup power in the home and vehicle-to-grid V2G

plug-in hybrid Toyota Prius conversion with PHEV-30 30mile or 48km all-electric range battery packs A plug-in hybrid s all-electric range is designated by PHEV- [miles] or PHEV [kilometers] km in which the number represents the distance the vehicle can travel on battery power alon For example a PHEV-20 can travel twenty miles 32km without using its combustion engine so it may also be designated as a PHEV32k The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 defines a plug-in electric drive vehicle as a vehicle that draws motive power from a battery with a capacity of at least 4 kilowatt hours can be recharged from an external source of electricity for motive power and is a light- medium- or heavy-duty motor vehicle or nonroad vehicle This distinguishes PHEVs from regular hybrid cars mass marketed today which do not use any electricity from the gri The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers IEEE defines PHEVs similarly but also requires that the hybrid electric vehicle be able to drive at least ten miles 16km in all-electric mode PHEV-10 PHEV16km while consuming no gasoline or diesel fuel The California Air Resources Board uses the term off-vehicle charge capable OVCC to mean having the capability to charge a battery from an off-vehicle electric energy source that cannot be connected or coupled to the vehicle in any manner while the vehicle is

information Hybrid vehicle drivetrains The Chevrolet Volt operates primarily as a series hybrid The Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid is a series-parallel hybrid PHEVs are based on the same three basic powertrain architectures as conventional electric hybrids Series hybrids use an internal combustion engine ICE to turn a generator which in turn supplies current to an electric motor which then rotates the vehicles drive wheel A battery or supercapacitor pack or a combination of the two can be used to store excess charg Examples of series hybrids vehicles include the Chevrolet Volt Fisker Karma Renault Kangoo Elect Road Toyota s Japan-only Coaster light-duty passenger bus Daimler AG s hybrid Orion bus Opel Flextreme concept car Swissauto REX VW Polo prototype and many diesel-electric locomotives With an appropriate balance of components this type can operate over a substantial distance with its full range of power without engaging the IC As is the case for other architectures series hybrids can operate without recharging as long as there is liquid fuel in the tan Parallel hybrids such as Honda s Insight Civic and Accord hybrids can simultaneously transmit power to their drive wheels from two distinct sourcesfor example an internal combustion engine and a battery-powered electric driv Although most parallel hybrids incorporate an electric motor between the vehicle s engine and transmission a parallel hybrid can also use its engine to drive one of the vehicle s axles while its electric motor drives the other axle and/or a generator used for recharging the batterie This type is called a road-coupled hybri The Audi Duo plug-in hybrid concept car is an example of this type of parallel hybrid architectur Parallel hybrids can be programmed to use the electric motor to substitute for the ICE at lower power demands as well as to substantially increase the power available to a smaller ICE both of which substantially increase fuel economy compared to a simple ICE vehicl Series-parallel hybrids have the flexibility to operate in either series or parallel mod Hybrid powertrains currently used by Ford Lexus Nissan and Toyota which some refer to as series-parallel with power-split can operate in both series and parallel mode at the same tim As of 2007 most plug-in hybrid conversions of conventional hybrids utilize this architectur The Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid operates as a series-parallel hybri Charging systems Batteries are DC devices while grid power is A In order to charge the batteries a DC charger must be utilize The charger can be located in several locations On-board chargers are mounted inside the vehicl Since the charger takes up space and adds weight its power capacity is generally limited by practical considerations avoiding carrying a more powerful charger that can only be fully utilized at certain location However carrying the charger along with the vehicle ensures that power will be available anywhere a power connection can be foun Off-board chargers can be as large as needed and mounted at fixed locations like the garage or dedicated charging station Built with dedicated wiring these chargers can handle much more power and charge the batteries more quickl However as the output of these chargers is DC each battery system requires the output to be changed for that ca Modern charging stations have a system for identifying the voltage of the battery pack and adjusting accordingl Using electric motor s inverter allows the motor windings to act as the transformer coils and the existing high-power inverter as the AC-to-DC charge As these components are already required on the car and are designed to handle any practical power capability they can be used to create a very powerful form of on-board charger with zero additional weight or siz AC Propulsion uses this charging method referred to as reductive charging Modes of operation Regardless of its architecture a plug-in hybrid may be capable of charge-depleting and charge-sustaining mode Combinations of these two modes are termed blended mode or mixed-mod These vehicles can be designed to drive for an extended range in all-electric mode either at low speeds only or at all speed These modes manage the vehicle s battery discharge strategy and their use has a direct effect on the size and type of battery required Charge-depleting mode allows a fully charged PHEV to operate exclusively or depending on the vehicle almost exclusively except during hard acceleration on electric power until its battery state of charge is depleted to a predetermined level at which time the vehicle s internal combustion engine or fuel cell will be engaged This period is the vehicle s all-electric range This is the only mode that a battery electric vehicle can operate in hence their limited rang The redesigned Renault Kangoo Elect road operates in blended mode using engine and battery power simultaneousl Blended mode is a kind of charge-depleting mod It is normally employed by vehicles which do not have enough electric power to sustain high speeds without the help of the internal combustion portion of the powertrai A blended control strategy typically increases the distance from stored grid electricity compared to a charge-depleting strateg The Renault Kangoo and some Toyota Prius conversions are examples of vehicles that use this mode of operatio The Electri cit and Elect road versions of the Kangoo were charge-depleting battery electric vehicles the Elect road had a modest internal combustion engine which extended its range somewha Conversions of 2004 and later model Toyota Prius can only run without using the ICE at speeds of less than about 42mph 68km/h due to the limits dictated by the vehicle s powertrain control softwar However at faster speeds electric power can still be used to displace gasoline thus improving the fuel economy in blended mode and generally doubling the fuel efficienc Charge-sustaining mode is used by production hybrid vehicles HEVs today and combines the operation of the vehicle s two power sources in such a manner that the vehicle is operating as efficiently as possible without allowing the battery state of charge to move outside a predetermined narrow ban Over the course of a trip in a HEV the state of charge may fluctuate but will have no net chang The battery in a HEV can thus be thought of as an energy accumulator rather than a fuel storage devic Once a plug-in hybrid has exhausted its all-electric range in charge-depleting mode it can switch into charge-sustaining mode automaticall Mixed mode describes a trip in which a combination of the above modes are utilize For example a PHEV-20 Prius conversion may begin a trip with 5 miles 8km of low speed charge-depleting then get onto a freeway and operate in blended mode for 20 miles 32km using 10 miles 16km worth of all-electric range at twice the fuel econom Finally the driver might exit the freeway and drive for another 5 miles 8km without the internal combustion engine until the full 20 miles 32km of all-electric range are exhauste At this point the vehicle can revert back to a charge sustaining-mode for another 10 miles 16km until the final destination is reache Such a trip would be considered a mixed mode as multiple modes are employed in one tri This contrasts with a charge-depleting trip which would be driven within the limits of a PHEV s all-electric rang Conversely the portion of a trip which extends beyond the all-electric range of a PHEV would be driven primarily in charge-sustaining mode as used by a conventional hybri Electric power storage Further information Electric vehicle battery Charging station PHEVs typically require deeper battery charging and discharging cycles than conventional hybrid Because the number of full cycles influences battery life this may be less than in traditional HEVs which do not deplete their batteries as full However some authors argue that PHEVs will soon become standard in the automobile industr Design issues and trade-offs against battery life capacity heat dissipation weight costs and safety need to be solve Advanced battery technology is under development promising greater energy densities by both mass and volume and battery life expectancy is expected to increas The cathodes of some early 2007 lithium-ion batteries are made from lithium-cobalt metal oxid This material is expensive and cells made with it can release oxygen if overcharge If the cobalt is replaced with iron phosphates the cells will not burn or release oxygen under any charg The price premium for early 2007 conventional hybrids is about US$5000 some US$3000 of which is for their NiMH battery pack At early 2007 gasoline and electricity prices that would mean a break-even point after six to ten years of operatio The conventional hybrid premium could fall to US$2000 in five years with US$1200 or more of that being cost of lithium-ion batteries providing for a three-year paybac The payback period may be longer for plug-in hybrids because of their larger more expensive batterie Nickelmetal hydride and lithium-ion batteries can be recycled Toyota for example has a recycling program in place under which dealers are paid a US$200 credit for each battery returne However plug-in hybrids typically use larger battery packs than comparable conventional hybrids and thus require more resource Pacific Gas and Electric Company PGE has suggested that utilities could purchase used batteries for backup and load leveling purpose They state that while these used batteries may be no longer usable in vehicles their residual capacity still has significant valu More recently General Motors GM has said it has been approached by utilities interested in using recycled Volt batteries as a power storage system a secondary market that could bring down the cost of the Volt and other plug-in vehicles for consumer Lithium iron phosphate LiFePO 4 is a class of cathode materials used in lithium iron phosphate batteries that is getting attention from the auto industr Valence Technologies produce a lithium iron manganese phosphate LiFeMnPO 4 battery with LG

in the U Recharging points also can be installed for specific uses as in taxicab stands Project Better Place began in October 2007 and is working with Renault on development of exchangeable batteries battery swapping Ultracapacitors or supercapacitors are used in some plug-in hybrids such as AFS Trinity s concept prototype to store rapidly available energy with their high power density in order to keep batteries within safe resistive heating limits and extend battery lif The CSIRO s UltraBattery combines a supercapacitor and a lead acid battery in a single unit creating a hybrid car battery that lasts longer costs less and is more powerful than current technologies used in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles PHEVs The optimum battery size varies depending on whether the aim is to reduce oil consumption running costs or emissions but a recent study concluded that The best choice of PHEV battery capacity depends critically on the distance that the vehicle will be driven between charge Our results suggest that for urban driving conditions and frequent charges every 10 miles or less a low-capacity PHEV sized with an AER all electric range of about 7 miles would be a robust choice for minimizing gasoline consumption cost and greenhouse gas emission For less frequent charging every 20100 miles PHEVs release fewer GHGs but HEVs are more cost effectiv Conversions of production

is that they have potential to be even more efficient than conventional hybrids because a more limited use of the PHEV s internal combustion engine may allow the engine to be used at closer to its maximum efficienc While a Prius is likely to convert fuel to motive energy on average at about 30% efficiency well below the engine s 38% peak efficiency the engine of a PHEV-70 would be likely to operate far more often near its peak efficiency because the batteries can serve the modest power needs at times when the combustion engine would be forced to run well below its peak efficienc The actual efficiency achieved depends on losses from electricity generation inversion battery charging/discharging the motor controller and motor itself the way a vehicle is used its duty cycle and the

vehicles and included language to address PHEV An SAE committee is currently working to review procedures for testing and reporting the fuel economy of PHEV The Toronto Atmospheric Fund tested ten retrofitted plug-in hybrid vehicles that achieved an average of 5.8 litres per 100 kilometre or 40.6 miles per gallon over six months in 2008 which was considered below the technology s potentia In real world testing using normal drivers some Prius PHEV conversions may not achieve much better fuel economy than HEV For example a plug-in Prius fleet each with a 30 miles 48km all-electric range averaged only 51mpg -US 4.6L/100km 61mpg -imp in a 17,000-mile 27,000km test in Seattle and similar results with the same kind of conversion battery models at Google.org Moreover the additional

Range anxiety elimination One of the main barriers for the general adoption of all-electric cars is the range anxiety factor the driver s fear of being stranded by a depleted battery before reaching the final destinatio Plug-in hybrids as opposed to pure plug-ins eliminate the range anxiety concerns because the gasoline engine serves as a back-up to recharge the battery to provide electric power to the electric motor or to provide propulsion directl In the case of the Volt access to a regular fuel station guarantees similar driving ranges as conventional gasoline-powered automobil One of the advantages of the PEV design is that the generator can be completely decoupled from the tractio Unlike a conventional engine which operates over a wide variety of power settings and operational conditions the range extender can be operated under optimum conditions at all time High-efficiency power sources that are not suitable for normal automotive use may be perfectly suitable for PEV us

Main article Vehicle-to-grid PHEVs and fully electric cars may allow for more efficient use of existing electric production capacity much of which sits idle as operating reserve most of the tim This assumes that vehicles are charged primarily during off peak periods i.e. at night or equipped with technology to shut off charging during periods of peak deman Another advantage of a plug-in vehicle is their potential ability to load balance or help the grid during peak load This is accomplished with vehicle-to-grid technolog By using excess battery capacity to send power back into the grid and then recharge during off peak times using cheaper power such vehicles are actually advantageous to utilities as well as their owner Even if such vehicles just led to an increase in the use of night time electricity they would even out electricity demand which is typically higher in the day time and provide a greater return on capital for electricity infrastructur In the UK VTG would need to

IEEE technical paper detailing a Toyota-approved project to add vehicle-to-grid capability to a Toyota Priu Although the technical paper described a method for generating voltage between respective lines of neutral points in the generator and motor of the THS-II Toyota Hybrid System to add a function for generating electricity it did not state whether or not the experimental vehicle could be charged through the circuit as wel However the vehicle was featured in a Toyota Dream House and a brochure for the exhibit stated that the house can supply electricity to the battery packs of the

President Barack Obama examines hybrid vehicles in the Edison Electric Vehicle Technical Center in Pomona California In November 2005 more than 50 leaders from public power utility companies across the United States met at the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power headquarters to discuss plug-in hybrid and vehicle-to-grid technolog The event which was sponsored by the American Public Power Association also provided an opportunity for association members to plan strategies that public power utility companies could use to promote plug-in hybrid technolog Greg Hanssen and Peter Nortman of EnergyCS and EDrive attended the two-day session and during a break in the proceedings made an impromptu display in the LADWP parking lot of their converted Prius plug-in hybri In September 2006 the California Air Resources Board held a Zero Emission Vehicle symposium that included several presentations on V2G technolog In April 2007 Pacific Gas and Electric Company showcased a PHEV at the Silicon Valley Leadership Alternative Energy Solutions Summit with vehicle-to-grid capability and demonstrated that it could be used as a source of emergency home power in the event of an electrical power failur Regulations intended to protect electricians against power other than from grid sources would need to be changed or regulations requiring consumers to disconnect from the grid when connected to non-grid sources will be required before such backup power solutions would be feasibl Federal Energy Regulatory Commissioner Jon Wellinghoff coined the term Cash-Back Hybrids to describe payments to car owners for putting their batteries on the power grid Batteries could also be offered in low-cost leasing or renting or by donation including maintenance to the car owners by the public utilities in a vehicle-to-grid agreemen Disadvantages Cost of batteries Main article Electric vehicle battery Disadvantages of plug-in hybrids include the additional cost weight and size of a larger battery pack According to a 2010 study by the National Research Council the cost of a lithium-ion battery pack is about US$1,700 kWh of usable energy and considering that a PHEV-10 requires about 2.0kWh and a PHEV-40 about 8kWh the manufacturer cost of the battery pack for a PHEV-10 is around US$3,000 and it goes up to US$14,000 for a PHEV-4 According to the same study even though costs are expected to decline by 35% by 2020 market penetration is expected to be slow and therefore PHEVs are not expected to significantly impact oil consumption or carbon emissions before 2030 unless a fundamental breakthrough in battery technologies occur Cost comparison between a PHEV-10 and a PHEV-40 prices for 2010 Plug-in type by EV range Similar production model Type of drivetrain Manufacturer additional cost compared to conventional non-hybrid mid-size Cost of battery pack Cost of electric system upgrade at home Expected gasoline savings compared to a HEV Annual gasoline savings compared to a HEV 2 PHEV-10 Prius Plug-in 1 Parallel US$6,300 US$3,300 More than US$1,000 20% 70 gallons PHEV-40 Chevy Volt Series US$18,100 US$14,000 More than US$1,000 55% 200 gallons Notes 1 Considers the HEV technology used in the Toyota Prius with a larger battery pac The Prius Plug-in estimated all-electric range is 14.5mi 23km 2 Assuming 15,000 miles per yea According to the 2010 NCR study although a mile driven on electricity is cheaper than one driven on gasoline lifetime fuel savings are not enough to offset plug-ins high upfront costs and it will take decades before the break even point is achieve Furthermore hundreds of billions of dollars in government subsidies and incentives are likely to be required to achieve a rapid plug-in market penetration in the U. A study published in 2011 by the Belfer Center Harvard University found that the gasoline costs savings of plug-in electric cars over the vehicles lifetimes do not offset their higher purchase price This finding was estimated comparing their lifetime net present value at 2010 purchase and operating costs for the U. market and assuming no government subidies According to the study estimates a PHEV-40 is US$5,377 more expensive than a conventional internal combustion engine while a battery electric vehicle BEV is US$4,819 more expensiv The study also examined how this balance will change over the next 10 to 20 years assuming that battery costs will decrease while gasoline prices increas Under the future scenarios considered the study found that BEVs will be significantly less expensive than conventional cars US$1,155 to US$7,181 cheaper while PHEVs will be more expensive than BEVs in almost all comparison scenarios and only less expensive than conventional cars in a scenario with very low battery costs and high gasoline price BEVs are simpler to build and do not use liquid fuel while PHEVs have more complicated powertrains and still have gasoline-powered engine Lithium iron phosphate batteries from Valence Technologies were used in the first plug-in hybrids from CalCars They are providing a conversion for the Toyota Prius priced at US$12,000 Hymotion also

charging unit located at the Hillsboro Civic Center in Hillsboro Oregon Many authors have assumed that plug-in recharging will take place overnight at hom However residents of cities apartments dormitories and townhouses do not have garages or driveways with available power outlets and they might be less likely to buy plug-ins unless recharging infrastructure is develope Electrical outlets or charging stations near their places of residence or in commercial or public parking lots or streets or workplaces are required for these potential users to gain the full advantage of PHEV Even house dwellers might need to charge at the office or to take advantage of opportunity charging at shopping center However this infrastructure is not in place today and it will require investments by both the private and public sector Several cities in California and Oregon and particularly San Francisco and other cities in the San Francisco Bay Area and Silicon Valley as well as some local private firms such as Google and Adobe Systems already have deployed charging stations and have expansion plans to attend both plug-ins and all-electric cars In Google s case its Mountain View campus

on a daily basis with performance results published on the RechargeIT websit Emissions shifted to electric plants in some countries Increased pollution is expected to occur in some areas with the adoption of PHEVs but most areas will experience a decreas A study by the ACEEE predicts that widespread PHEV use in heavily coal-dependent areas would result in an increase in local net sulfur dioxide and mercury emissions given emissions levels from most coal plants currently supplying power to the gri Although clean coal technologies could create power plants which supply grid power from coal without emitting significant amounts of such pollutants the higher cost of the application of these technologies may increase the price of coal-generated electricit The net effect on pollution is dependent on the fuel source of the electrical grid fossil or renewable for example and the pollution profile of the power plants themselve Identifying regulating and upgrading single point pollution source such as a power plantor replacing a plant altogethermay also be more practica From a human health perspective shifting pollution away from large urban areas may be considered a significant advantag According to a 2009 study by The National Academy of Science Electric vehicles and grid-dependent plug-in hybrid vehicles showed somewhat higher nonclimate damages than many other technologie Efficiency of plug-in hybrids is also impacted by the overall efficiency of electric power transmission Transmission and distribution losses in the USA were estimated at 7.2% in 1995 and 6.5% in 200 By life cycle analysis of air pollution emissions natural gas vehicles are currently the lowest emitter [ citation needed ] Tiered rate structure for electric bills Electric utility companies generally do not utilize flat rate pricin For example Pacific Gas and Electric PGE normally charges $0.10 per kilowatt hour kWh for the base tier but additional tiers are priced as high as $0.30 per kWh to customers without electric vehicle Some utilities offer electric vehicle users a rate tariff that provides discounts for off-peak usage such as overnight rechargin PGE offers a special discounted rate for plug-in and other electric vehicle customers the Experimental Time-of-Use Low Emission Vehicle rat That tariff gives people much cheaper rates if they charge at night especially during the summer month The additional electrical utilization required to recharge the plug-in vehicles could push many households in areas that do not have off-peak tariffs into the higher priced tier and negate financial benefit Without an off-peak charging tariff one study of a certain PHEV-20 model having an all-electric range of 20 miles gasoline-fueled efficiency of 52.7mi/gal U.S. and all-electric efficiency of 4mi/kWh found that household electricity customers who consumed 131%200% of baseline electricity at $0.220 kWh would see benefits if gasoline was priced above US$2.89/US gal those that consumed 201%300% of baseline electricity at $0.303 kWh would only see benefits if gas was priced above $3.98 and households consuming over 300% of baseline electricity at $0.346 kWh would only see benefits if gasoline was priced above $4.55 USD/gal Off-peak tariff rates can lower the break-even poin The PGE tariff would change those break-even gasoline prices to USD $1.96 $3.17 and $3.80 per gallon respectively for the given PHEV and usage pattern in questio Customers under such tariffs could see significant savings by being careful about when the vehicle was charged for example by using a timer to restrict charging to off-peak hour Thus an accurate comparison of the benefit requires each household to evaluate its current electrical usage tier and tariffs weighed against the cost of gasoline and the actual observed operational cost of electric mode vehicle operatio The Salar de Uyuni in Bolivia is one of the largest known lithium reserves in the worl Lithium availability and supply security See also Lithium and rare earth metals availability and supply security Current technology for plug-ins is based on the lithium-ion battery and an electric motor and the demand for lithium heavy metals and other rare elements such as neodymium boron and cobalt required for the batteries and powertrain is expected to grow significantly due to the incoming market entrance of plug-ins and electric vehicles in the mid and long ter Some of the largest world reserves of lithium and other rare metals are located in countries with strong resource nationalism unstable governments or hostile to U. interests raising concerns about the risk of replacing dependence on foreign oil with a new dependence on hostile countries to supply strategic material Currently the main deposits of lithium are found in China and South America throughout the Andes mountain chai In 2008 Chile was the leading lithium metal producer followed by Australia China and Argentina In the United States lithium is recovered from brine pools in Nevada Nearly half the world s known reserves are located in Bolivia and according to the US Geological Survey Bolivia s Salar de Uyuni desert has 5.4 million tons of lithium which can be used to make lithium batteries for hybrid and electric vehicles Other important reserves are located in Chile China and Brazil Regarding rare earth elements most reserves are located in China which controls the world market for these element Greenhouse gas emissions See also Greenhouse gas emissions in plug-in electric vehicles The effect of PHEVs on greenhouse emissions is comple Plug-in hybrid vehicles operating on all-electric mode do not emit harmful tailpipe pollutants from the onboard source of powe The clean air benefit is usually local because depending on the source of the electricity used to recharge the batteries air pollutant emissions are shifted to the location of the generation plant In the same way PHEVs do not emit greenhouse gases from the onboard source of power but from the point of view of a well-to-wheel assessment the extent of the benefit also depends on the fuel and technology used for electricity generation From the perspective of a full life cycle analysis the electricity used to recharge the batteries must be generated from renewable or clean sources such as wind solar hydroelectric or nuclear power for PEVs to have almost none or zero well-to-wheel emission On the other hand when PEVs are recharged from coal -fired plants they usually produce slightly more greenhouse gas emissions than internal combustion engine vehicle In the case of plug-in hybrid electric vehicle when operating in hybrid mode with assistance of the internal combustion engine tailpipe and greenhouse emissions are lower in comparison to conventional cars because of their higher fuel economy There has been much debate over the potential GHG emissions reductions that can be achieved with PHE A study by the Electric Power Research Institute reports that a 338 TWh or 5.8% increase in power generation needed as a result of PHE In the same report the EPRI also states that CO 2 emissions could increase by 430 million metric ton The article concludes In summary the addition of PHEVs as a significant transportation option adds approximately 6% to the total national electricity demand in 2030 compared to the base case with no PHEV Due to the charging profile that results in most of this additional demand occurring during off-peak hours late night/early morning there is an increase in the need for baseload generatio The addition of coal-fired generation to meet this need for more baseload generation does not result in any significant differences in annual emissions of SO 2 NO x and Hg because of the caps on those pollutant Therefore any reductions in emissions of SO 2 NO x or Hg from non-electric generating sources would result in a net national decline in these emission However it does result in an appreciable increase in CO 2 and PM emissions as this analysis has not assumed any limits on CO 2 or PM emissions A study by the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy ACEEE predicts that on average a typical American driver is expected to achieve about a 15% reduction in net CO 2 emissions compared to the driver of a regular hybrid based on the 2005 distribution of power sources feeding the US electrical gri The ACEEE study also predicts that in areas where more than 80% of grid-power comes from coal-burning power plants local net CO 2 emissions will increase while for PHEVs recharged in areas where the grid is fed by power sources with lower CO 2 emissions than the current average net CO 2 emissions associated with PHEVs will decrease correspondingl A 2007 joint study by the Electric Power Research Institute EPRI and the Natural Resources Defense Council NRDC similarly found that the introduction of PHEVs into Americas consumer vehicle fleet could achieve significant greenhouse gas emission reduction The EPRI-NRDC report estimates that between 2010 and 2050 a shift toward PHEV use could reduce GHG emissions by 3.4 to 10.4 billion metric ton The magnitude of these reductions would ultimately depend on the level of PHEV market penetration and the carbon intensity of the US electricity secto In general PHEVs can be viewed as an element in the Pacala and Socolow wedges approach which shows a way to stabilize CO 2 emissions using a portfolio of existing techniques including efficient vehicle A 2008 study at Duke University suggests that for PHEV s to reduce greenhouse gas emissions more than hybrids a carbon pricing signal that encourages the development of low carbon power is neede RAND also in 2008 studied the questions of a carbon tax carbon cap and trade systems increasing gasoline tax and providing renewable energy subsidies under various economic conditions and vehicle type availabilitie RAND found that subsidies were able to provide a smoother transition to new energy sources especially in the face of energy source price volatility because subsidies can be structured according to relative costs between renewables and fossil fuel while taxes and carbon trading schemes alone do not take relative prices of energy into accoun The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency found that if Minnesota s fleet of vehicles making lengthy trips were replaced by plug-in hybrids CO 2 emissions per vehicle would likely decreas However unless more than 40% of the electricity used to charge the vehicles were to come from non-polluting sources replacing the vehicles with non-plug-in hybrids would engender a larger decrease in CO 2 emission Plug-in hybrids use less fuel in all cases and produce much less carbon dioxide in short commuter trips which is how most vehicles are use The difference is such that overall carbon emissions would decrease if all internal combustion vehicles were converted to plug-in In 2009 researchers at Argonne National Laboratory adapted their GREET model to conduct a full well-to-wheels WTW analysis of energy use and greenhouse gas GHG emissions of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles for several scenarios considering different on-board fuels and different sources of electricity generation for recharging the vehicle batterie Three US regions were selected for the analysis California New York and Illinois as these regions include major metropolitan areas with significant variations in their energy generation mixe The full cycle analysis results were also reported for the US generation mix and renewable electricity to examine cases of average and clean mixes respectively This 2009 study showed a wide spread of petroleum use and GHG emissions among the different fuel production technologies and grid generation mixe The following table summarizes the main results PHEV well-to-wheels Petroleum energy use and greenhouse gas emissions for an all-electric range

Transportation Research Argonne National Laboratory 2009 See Table Notes 1 Simulations for year 2020 with PHEV model year 201 2 No direct or indirect land use changes included in the WTW analysis for bio-mass fuel feedstock The Argonne study found that PHEVs offered reductions in petroleum energy use as compared with regular hybrid electric vehicle More petroleum energy savings and also more GHG emissions reductions were realized as the all-electric range increased except when electricity used to recharged was dominated by coal or oil-fired power generatio As expected electricity from renewable sources realized the largest reductions in petroleum energy use and GHG emissions for all PHEVs as the all-electric range increase The study also concluded that plug-in vehicles that employ biomass-based fuels biomass-E85 and -hydrogen may not realize GHG emissions benefits over regular hybrids if power generation is dominated by fossil source A 2008 study by researchers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory analyzed oil use and greenhouse gas GHG emissions of plug-in hybrids relative to hybrid electric vehicles under several scenarios for years 2020 and 203 Each type of vehicle was assumed to run 20 miles 32km per day and the HEV was assumed to have a fuel economy of 40miles per US gallon 5.9L/100km 48mpg -imp The study considered the mix of power sources for 13 U. regions generally a combination of coal natural gas and nuclear energy and to a lesser extend renewable energ A 2010 study conducted at Argonne National Laboratory reached similar findings concluding that PHEVs will reduce oil consumption but could produce very different greenhouse gas emissions for each region depending on the energy mix used to generate the electricity to recharge the plug-in hybrid
