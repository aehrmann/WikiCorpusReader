cities and contributes to a more temperate climate than is found in cities at similar latitude Under the Kppen classification it has a humid subtropical climate Cfa with very warm and humid summers and mild yet temperamental winter The warm maritime air can bring spring-like highs while strong Arctic air masses can push lows into the teens 7 C High temperatures in July average 89 F 32C but

Cityscape Main articles Architecture of Atlanta and Neighborhoods of Atlanta See also List of tallest buildings in Atlanta The Downtown skyline The Midtown skyline The Buckhead skyline Most of Atlanta was burned during the Civil War depleting the city of a large stock of its historic architectur Yet architecturally the city had never been particularly southernbecause Atlanta originated as a railroad town rather than a patrician southern seaport like Savannah or Charleston many of the citys landmarks could have easily been erected in the Northeast or Midwes In addition unlike many other Southern cities such as Richmond and New Orleans Atlanta chose not to retain its historic architectural characteristics instead viewing itself as the leading city of a progressive New South and opting for expressive modern structure Peachtree Street in Midtown Atlanta As a result of Atlantas embrace of modernism its cityscape is dominated by relatively recent architectural styles containing works by most major U. firms and some of the more prominent architects of the 20th centur The citys skyline which began its marked rise in the 1960s is punctuated with buildings of both modern and postmodern vintag At 1,023 feet 312m Atlantas tallest skyscraperthe Bank of America Plaza is the 52nd-tallest building in the world and the 9th tallest building in the United State The citys embrace of modern architecture resulted in an ambivalent approach toward historic preservation leading to the destruction of notable architectural landmarks including the Equitable Building Atlantas first skyscraper Terminal Station and the Carnegie Library The Fox Theatre Atlantas cultural iconwould have met the same fate had it not been for a grassroots effort to save it in the mid-1970 Atlanta is divided into 242 officially defined neighborhoods The city contains three major high-rise districts which form a north-south axis along Peachtree Downtown Midtown and Buckhead Surrounding these high-density districts are leafy low-density neighborhoods most of which are dominated by single-family home Downtown Atlanta contains the most office space in the metro area much of it occupied by government entitie Downtown is also home to the citys sporting venues and many of its tourist attraction Midtown Atlanta is the citys second-largest business district containing the offices of many of the regions law firm Midtown is also known for its art instritutions cultural attractions institutions of higher education and dense for Buckhead the citys uptown district is eight miles 13km north of Downtown and the citys third-largest business distric The district is marked by an urbanized core along Peachtree Road surrounded by suburban single-family neighborhoods situated among dense forests and rolling hill Craftsman bungalows in Inman Park Surrounding Atlantas three high-rise districts are the city s low- and medium-density neighborhoods The citys east side is marked by historic streetcar suburbs built from the 1890s-1930s as havens for the upper middle clas These neighborhoods many of which contain their own villages encircled by shaded architecturally distinct residential streets include the Victorian Inman Park craftsman Kirkwood Bohemian East Atlanta and eclectic Old Fourth Ward On Atlantas west side former warehouses and factories have been converted into housing retail space and art galleries transforming the once-industrial West Midtown into a model neighborhood for smart growth historic rehabilitation and infill constructio In southwest Atlanta neighborhoods closer to downtown originated as streetcar suburbs including the historic West End while those farther from downtown retain a postwar suburban layout including Collier Heights and Cascade Heights home to much of the city s affluent African American populatio Northwest Atlanta marked by Atlantas poorest and most crime-ridden neighborhoods has been the target of community outreach programs and economic development initiative Gentrification of the city s neighborhoods is one of the more controversial and transformative forces shaping contemporary Atlant The gentrification of Atlanta has its origins in the 1970s after many of Atlanta s neighborhoods had undergone the urban decay that affected other major American cities in the mid-20th centur When neighborhood opposition successfully prevented two freeways from being built through citys the east side in 1975 the area became the starting point for Atlanta s gentrification After Atlanta was awarded the Olympic games in 1990 gentrification expanded into other parts of the city stimulated by infrastructure improvements undertaken in preparation for the game Gentrification was also aided by the Atlanta Housing Authority s eradication of the citys public housin The gentrification of the citys neighborhoods has been the topic of social commentary including The Atlanta Way a documentary

disproportionately affected by the 2008 financial crisis and the subsequent recessio The citys economic problems are displayed in its elevated unemployment rate declining real income levels and depressed housing marke From 2010-2011 Atlanta saw a 0.9% contraction in employment and a meager 0.4% rise in incom As of 2012 the unemployment rate in Atlanta was over 9% higher the national average of 8.2 These dismal statistics have garnered Atlanta recognition as one of the worlds worst economic performers with the citys economy earning a ranking of 189 among 200 global cities down from a ranking of 89 during the 1990s when the city realized 1.6% income growth and 2.6% employment growt However even when the 2008-2009 period is excluded the 2001-2007 period is still one of the worst on record for Atlanta the city never recovered the jobs it lost during the Early 2000s recession and per capita income declined nearly 5% from 2000 to 2006 the largest decline among major U. citie Thus Atlantas current economic crisis was only worsened and not caused by the Recessio Adding to the citys employment and income woes is the spectacular collapse of its housing marke Atlanta home prices fell by 2.1% in January 2012 reaching levels not seen since 1996 a decline that measured among the worst in the countr Compared with a year earlier the average home price in Atlanta fell 17.3% in February 2012 the largest annual drop in the history of the index for any cit Atlanta home values average $85,000 as of January 2012 second-worst among major metropolitan areas coming in just behind

the South has a culture that is no longer strictly Southern This is because in addition to a large population of migrants from other parts of the U.S. many recent immigrants to the U. have chosen to make the city their home making Atlanta one of the most multi-cultural in the natio Thus although traditional Southern culture is part of Atlantas cultural fabric it is mostly the backdrop to one of
