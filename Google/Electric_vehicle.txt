trains do not need to carry a heavy internal combustion engine or large batteries they can have very good power-to-weight ratios This allows high speed trains such as France s double-deck TGVs to operate at speeds of 320km/h 200mph or higher and electric locomotives to have a much higher power output than diesel locomotives In addition they have higher short-term surge power for fast

Energy and motors A trolleybus uses two overhead wires to provide electric current supply and return to the power source An electric bus at Lucerne Most large electric transport systems are powered by stationary sources of electricity that are directly connected to the vehicles through wire Electric traction allows the use of regenerative braking in which the motors are used as brakes and become generators that transform the motion of usually a train into electrical power that is then fed back into the line This system is particularly advantageous in mountainous operations as descending vehicles can produce a large portion of the power required for those ascendin This regenerative system is only viable if the system is large enough to utilise the power generated by descending vehicle In the systems above motion is provided by a rotary electric motor However it is possible to unroll the motor to drive directly against a special matched trac These linear motors are used in maglev trains which float above the rails supported by magnetic levitation This allows for almost no rolling resistance of the vehicle and no mechanical wear and tear of the train or trac In addition to the high-performance control systems needed switching and curving of the tracks becomes difficult with linear motors which to date has restricted their operations to high-speed point to point service

small as a motorized shopping cart or wheelchair through pedilecs electric motorcycles and scooters neighborhood electric vehicles industrial fork-lift trucks and including many hybrid vehicles Energy sources Although electric vehicles have few direct emissions all rely on energy created through electricity generation and will usually emit pollution and generate waste unless it is generated by renewable source power plant Since electric vehicles use whatever electricity is delivered by their electrical utility/grid operator electric vehicles can be made more or less efficient polluting and expensive to run by modifying the electrical generating station This would be done by an electrical utility under a government energy policy in a timescale negotiated between utilities and governmen Fossil fuel vehicle efficiency and pollution standards take years to filter through a nation s fleet of vehicle New efficiency and pollution standards rely on the purchase of new vehicles often as the current vehicles already on the road reach their end-of-lif Only a few nations set a retirement age for old vehicles such as Japan or Singapore forcing periodic upgrading of all vehicles already on

of the different methods of charging possible the emissions produced have been quantified in different way Plug-in all-electric and hybrid vehicles also have different consumption characteristic Electromagnetic radiation Electromagnetic radiation from high performance electrical motors has been claimed to be associated with some human ailments but such claims are largely unsubstantiated except for extremely high exposure Electric motors can be shielded within a metallic Faraday cage but this reduces efficiency by adding weight to the vehicle while it is not conclusive that all electromagnetic radiation can be containe Charging Grid capacity If a large proportion of private vehicles were to convert to grid electricity it would increase the demand for generation and transmission and consequent emission However overall energy consumption and emissions would diminish because of the higher efficiency of electric vehicles over the entire cycl In the USA it has been

overnight and often gives a charge that is sufficient for normal everyday usag However with the widespread implementation of electric vehicle networks within large cities such as those provided by POD

anxiety A recharging system that avoids the need for a cable is Curb Connect patented in 2012 by Dr Gordon Dowe In this system electrical contacts are fitting into curbs such as angle parking spaces on city street When a suitably authorized vehicle is parked so that its front end overhangs the curb the curb contacts become energized and charging occur Another proposed solution for daily recharging is a standardized inductive charging system such as Evatran s Plugless Power Benefits are the convenience of with parking over the charge station and minimized cabling and connection infrastructur Qualcomm is trialling such a system in London in early 201 Yet another proposed solution for the typically less frequent long distance travel is rapid charging such as the Aerovironment

requires many times more battery packs to be in the syste One type of battery replacement proposed vanadium redox battery is much simpler while the latest generation of vanadium redox battery only has an energy density similar to lead-acid the charge is stored solely in a vanadium-based electrolyte which can be pumped out and replaced with charged fluid [ citation needed ] The vanadium battery system is also a potential candidate for intermediate energy storage in quick charging stations because of its high power density and extremely good endurance in daily use [ citation needed ] System cost however is still prohibitiv As vanadium battery systems are estimated to range between $350$600 per kWh a battery that can service one hundred customers in a 24 hour period at 50 kWh per charge would cost $1.8-$3 million [ citation needed ] According to Department of Energy research conducted at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory 84% of existing vehicles could be switched over to plug-in hybrids without requiring any new grid infrastructur In terms of transportation the net result would be a 27% total reduction in emissions of the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide a 31% total reduction in nitrogen oxides a slight reduction in nitrous oxide emissions an increase in particulate matter emissions the same sulfur dioxide emissions and the near elimination of carbon monoxide and volatile organic compound emissions a 98% decrease in carbon monoxide and a 93% decrease in volatile organic compounds The emissions would be displaced away from street level where they have high human-health implication Battery swapping Instead of recharging electric vehicles from electric socket batteries could be mechanically replaced on special stations in a couple of minutes battery swapping Batteries with greatest energy density such as metal-air fuel cells usually cannot be recharged in purely electric wa Instead some kind of metallurgical process is needed such

a system was patented in 2000 by Dr Gordon Dower and three road-licensed prototypes have been built by the Ridek Corporation in Point Roberts Washingto Dr Dower has proposed that an individual might own only the body or perhaps a few different style bodies for their vehicle and would lease the chassis from a pool thereby reducing the depreciation costs associated with vehicle ownershi Other

electric cars to ensure that cars with a high voltage electric power train such as hybrid and fully electric vehicles are as safe as combustion cars The EU and Japan have already indicated that they intend to incorporate the new UNECE Regulation in their respective rules on technical standards for vehicles There is a growing concern about the safety of electric vehicles their charging systems and their batteries But electric vehicles must meet all the same safety standards as conventional vehicle For functional safety there are already standards available ISO 26262 and IEC 61508 as well as for charging systems UL 2202 UL 2251 or UL Subject 2594 For batteries chemical and mechanical components certain tests and simulations can be performed to validate and certify their safet The National

House of Representatives is holding a hearing on the matter in January 201 Automotive consulting firm CNW Marketing Research discovered a decline in consumer interest in the Volt citing the fires as having made an impact on consumer perceptio Advocates of EVs are concerned that the focus of the media and the reaction of U. Representative Jim Jordan are unwarrante The fires leading to the investigations occurred only during NHTSA controlled crashes including simulated rolling of the vehicle In contrast 184,000 vehicles caught fire on U. roads in 201 Advantages and disadvantages of electric vehicles Environmental Due to efficiency of electric engines as compared to combustion engines even when the electricity used to charge electric vehicles comes from a CO 2 -emitting source such as a coal- or gas-fired powered plant the net CO 2 production from an electric car is typically one-half to one-third of that from a comparable combustion vehicl Electric vehicles release almost no air pollutants at the place where they are operate In addition it is generally easier to build pollution-control systems into centralised power stations than retrofit enormous numbers of car Electric vehicles typically have less noise pollution than an internal combustion engine vehicle whether it is at rest or in motio Electric vehicles emit no tailpipe CO 2 or pollutants such as NOx NMHC CO and PM at the point of us Electric motors don t require oxygen unlike internal combustion engines this is useful for submarines While electric and hybrid cars have reduced tailpipe carbon emissions the energy they consume is sometimes produced by means that have environmental impact For example the majority of electricity produced in the United States comes from fossil fuels coal and natural gas so use of an electric vehicle in the United States would not be completely carbon neutral Electric and hybrid cars can help decrease energy use and pollution with local no pollution at all being generated by electric vehicles and may someday use only renewable resources but the choice that would have the lowest negative environmental impact would be a lifestyle change in favor of walking biking use of public transit or telecommuting Governments may invest in research and development of electric cars

city va Electric motors are mechanically very simpl Electric motors often achieve 90% energy conversion efficiency over the full range of speeds and power output and can be precisely controlle They can also be combined with regenerative braking systems that have the ability to convert movement energy back into stored electricit This can be used to reduce the wear on brake systems and consequent brake pad dust and reduce the total energy requirement of a tri Regenerative braking is especially effective for start-and-stop city us They can be finely controlled and provide high torque from rest unlike internal combustion engines and do not need multiple gears to match power curve This removes the need for gearboxes and torque converters Electric vehicles provide quiet and smooth operation and consequently have less noise and vibration than internal combustion engine While this is a desirable attribute it has also evoked concern that the absence of the usual sounds of an approaching vehicle poses a danger to blind elderly and very young pedestrian To mitigate this situation automakers and individual companies are developing systems that produce warning sounds when electric vehicles are moving slowly up to a speed when normal motion and rotation road suspension electric motor et noises become audibl Energy resilience Electricity is a form of energy that remains within the country or region where it was produced and can be multi-source As a result it gives the greatest degree of energy resilience Energy efficiency Electric vehicle tank-to-wheels efficiency is about a factor of 3 higher than internal combustion engine vehicles Energy is not consumed while the vehicle is stationary unlike internal combustion engines which consume fuel while idlin However looking at the well-to-wheel efficiency of electric vehicles their total emissions while still lower are closer to an efficient gasoline or diesel in most countries where electricity generation relies on fossil fuel It is worth noting that well-to-wheel efficiency of an electric vehicle has far less to do with the vehicle itself and more to do with the method of electricity productio A particular electric vehicle would instantly become twice as efficient if electricity production were switched from fossil fuel to a wind or tidal primary source of energ Thus when well-to-wheels is cited one should keep in mind that the discussion is no longer about the vehicle but rather about the entire energy supply infrastructure - in the case of fossil fuels this should also include energy spent on exploration mining refining and distributio Cost of recharge According to General Motors as reported by CNN Money the GM Volt will cost less than purchasing a cup of your favorite coffee to recharg The Volt should cost less than 2 cents per mile to drive on electricity compared with 12 cents a mile on gasoline at a price of $3.60 a gallo This means a trip from Los Angeles to New York would cost $56 on electricity and $336 with gasolin This would be the equivalent to paying 60 cents a gallon of ga The reality is that the cost of operating an EV varies wildly depending on the part of the world in which the owner live In some locations an EV costs less to drive than a comparable gas-powered vehicle as long as the higher initial purchase-price is not factored in i. a pure comparison of gasoline cost to electricity cost In the USA however in states which have a tiered electricity rate schedule fuel for electric vehicles today costs owners significantly more than fuel for a comparable gas-powered vehicl A study done by Purdue University found that in California most users already reach the third pricing tier for electricity each month and adding an electric vehicle could push them into the fourth or fifth highest most expensive tier meaning that they will be paying in excess of $.45 cents per KWH for electricity to recharge their vehicl At this price which is higher than the average electricity price in the US it is dramatically more expensive to drive a pure-electric vehicle than it is to drive a traditional pure-gas powered vehicl The objective of a tiered pricing system is to discourage consumptio It s meant to get you to think about turning off your lights and conserving electricit In California the unintended consequence is that plug-in hybrid cars won t be economical under this system said Tyner the author whose findings were published in the online version of the journal Energy Polic Stabilization of the grid Since electric vehicles can be plugged into the electric grid when not in use there is a potential for battery powered vehicles to even out the demand for electricity by feeding electricity into the grid from their batteries during peak use periods such as midafternoon air conditioning use while doing most of their charging at night when there is unused generating capacit This Vehicle to Grid V2G connection has the potential to reduce the need for new power plants as long as vehicle owners do not mind their batteries being drained during the day by the power company prior to needing to use their vehicle for a return-commute home in the evenin Furthermore our current electricity infrastructure may need to cope with increasing shares of variable-output power sources such as windmills and PV solar panel This variability could be addressed by adjusting the speed at which EV batteries are charged or possibly even discharge Some concepts see battery exchanges and battery charging stations much like gas/petrol stations toda Clearly these will require enormous storage and charging potentials which could be manipulated to vary the rate of charging and to output power during shortage periods much as diesel generators are used for short periods to stabilize some national grid Range Many electric designs have limited range due to the low energy density of batteries compared to the fuel of internal combustion engined vehicle Electric vehicles also often have long recharge times compared to the relatively fast process of refueling a tan This is further complicated by the current scarcity of public charging station Range anxiety is a label for consumer concern about EV rang Heating of electric vehicles In cold climates considerable energy is needed to heat the interior of a vehicle and to defrost the window With internal combustion engines this heat already exists as waste combustion heat diverted from the engine cooling circui This process offsets the greenhouse gases external cost If this is done with battery electric vehicles the interior heating requires extra energy from the vehicles batterie Although some heat could be harvested from the motor s and battery their greater efficiency means there is not as much waste heat available as from a combustion engine However for vehicles which are connected to the grid battery electric vehicles can be preheated or cooled with little or no need for battery energy especially for short trip Newer designs are focused on using super- insulated cabins which can heat the vehicle using the body heat of the passenger This is not enough however in colder climates as a driver delivers only about 100 W of heating powe A reversible AC-system cooling the cabin during summer and heating it during winter seems to be the most practical and promising way of solving the thermal management of the E Ricardo Arboix introduced 2008 a new concept based on the principle of combining the thermal-management of the EV-battery with the thermal-management of the cabin using a reversible AC-syste This is done by adding a third heat-exchanger thermally connected with the battery-core to the traditional heat pump/air conditioning system used in previous EV-models like the GM EV1 and Toyota RAV4 E The concept has proven to bring several benefits such as prolonging the life-span of the battery as well as improving the performance and overall energy-efficiency of the E Electric public transit efficiency Shifts from private to public transport train trolleybus or tram have the potential for large gains in efficiency in terms of individual miles per kWh Research shows people do prefer trams because they are quieter and more comfortable and perceived as having higher statu Therefore it may be possible to cut liquid fossil fuel consumption in cities through the use of electric tram Trams may be the most energy-efficient form of public transportation with rubber wheeled vehicles using 2/3 more energy than the equivalent tram

Ron Dellums announced a nine-step policy plan for transforming the Bay Area into the Electric Vehicle EV Capital of the U. Other local and state governments have also expressed interest in electric car In March 2009 as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act the U. Department of Energy announced the release of two competitive solicitations for up to $2 billion in federal funding for competitively awarded cost-shared agreements for manufacturing of advanced batteries and related drive components as well as up to $400 million for transportation electrification demonstration and deployment project This announcement will also help meet President Barack Obama s goal of putting one million plug-in hybrid vehicles on the road by 201 The American Clean Energy and Security Act ACES which passed the Energy and Commerce Committee on May 21 2009 has extensive provisions for electric car The bill calls for all electric utilities to develop a plan to support the use of plug-in electric drive vehicles including heavy-duty hybrid electric vehicles The bill also provides for smart grid integration allowing for more efficient effective delivery of electricity to accommodate the additional demands of plug-in electric vehicle Finally the bill allows for the Department of Energy to fund projects that support the development of electric vehicle and smart grid technology and infrastructur The House of Representatives passed legislation in late 2008 enumerating tax credits ranging from $2500 to $7500 for electric vehicle buyer The actual credit varies depending on the specified vehicle s battery capacit The Chevrolet Volt and the Tesla vehicles are eligible for the full $7500 credi The bill called for the credit to be applicable for the first 250,000 vehicles sold per manufacture The credits were passed in 2008 but went into effect on January 1 2009 and can be currently used on the Tesla all-electric model The Volt plug-in Prius and other PHEVs and BEVs will also be eligible for the credit when they are released in the coming year The new credits update incentives introduced in 2006 that offered credits for gas-electric hybrids Based on a formula determined by vehicle weight technology and fuel economy compared to base year models which expired after 60,000 units per manufacture The new credits will only apply to plug-in EVs and all-electric vehicle European Union Electrification of transport electromobility figures prominently in the Green Car Initiative GCI included in the European Economic Recovery Pla DG TREN is supporting a large European electromobility project on electric vehicles and related infrastructure with a total budget of around 50-million as part of the Green Car Initiativ There are measures to promote efficient vehicles in the Directive 2009/33/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the promotion of clean and energy-efficient road transport vehicles and in the Directive 2006/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2006 on energy end-use efficiency and energy service AVERE has a table summarizing the taxation and incentives for these vehicles in the different European countries related to state subsidies reduction of VAT and other taxes insurance facilities parking and charging facilities including free recharging on street or in the parking areas EVs imposed by law and banned circulation for petroleum cars permission to use bus lanes free road tax toll free travel on highways exemption from congestion charging free or reduced parking rates and free charging at charge points amongst other initiative In Denmark petrol cars are taxed at 180% + 25% however EV cars ma 2000kg total weight are only taxed at 25 Free parking is also offered to EVs in Copenhagen and other cities and there is free recharging at some parking space EU member states Republic of Ireland In the Republic of Ireland in 2010 then Green Party minister for Energy Eamon Ryan announced a scheme to deploy 1,500 electrical recharging stations for use with EV In addition 30 high voltage fast charging units will be deployed providing a high speed recharge facility every 60km on interurban route Electricity supplied from these recharging points will be free initiall Additional incentives towards the purchase of EVs were announced including a 5,000 capital gran Series production electric vehicles have been exempted from VRT Annual motor tax for electric vehicles is 10 The Government has set a target of 10% for all vehicles on Irish roads to be electric by 202 Finland The Prime Minister of Finland 20032010 M Matti Vanhanen has mentioned that he wants to see more electric cars on Finnish roads as soon as possible and with any cost to the governmental car related tax income Charging at home from motor and cabin heating outlets common in all Nordic countries has been determined to be a possible load on the gri If all cars in Finland run totally on electricity it will add 7-9 TWh annually to the load which corresponds to 10% of Finland s annual consumptio On-line route planners like list a daily growing number of free charging outlets set up by merchants and private individuals making it possible to drive an EV for free from Helsinki through Sweden all the way to Copenhage Denmark Denmark was planning to introduce a greater number of battery driven electric cars on the streets charged on renewable energy from the country s many windmills ahead of the UN Climate Summit that descended on Copenhagen in December 200 A great deal of the electricity is generated by windmills Germany Smart ED all-electric car right and Opel Ampera plug-in hybrid left in Germany National Electric Mobility Platform NEMP is a German government initiative to develop Germany into a leading market for electric mobility with about 1 million electric vehicles on its streets by 202 As the latest development October 2010 DBM Energy s electric Audi A2 completes record setting 372-mile 599km drive on a single charg Portugal The Portuguese Government launched in early 2008 a national Programme for Electric Mobility called Mobi.E MOBI.E is based on an innovative approach to electric mobilit It has an open-access and market-oriented philosophy and as a result it proposes a fully integrated and totally interoperable system multi-retailer and multi-operator mode Rather than a local experience Mobi.E is deploying a national electric mobility syste However the system was designed to be scalable and used in multiple geographies overcoming the current situation of lack of communication among the different electric mobility experiences that are being deployed in Europ Mobi.E allows any individual the access to any provider of electricity in any charging point explored by any service operato This ensures transparency low entry barriers and competition along the value chain with the goal of attracting private investors and benefiting the users contributing to a faster expansion of the syste Therefore Portugal is one of the first countries in the world to have an integrated policy for electric mobility and a national charging network for Electric Vehicle By the first semester of 2011 a wide public network of 1 300 normal and 50 fast charging points will be fully implemented in the main 25 cities of the country thus allowing electric vehicle users the ability to travel throughout the country in all comfort and safet In the top of the system there is a Managing Authority which acts as a Clearing House and intermediates the financial information and energy flows among users electricity sellers operators of charging points and the providers of any other associated servic Additionally several measures were taken to increase the demand for EVs in Portugal 1 EVs are fully exempt from both the Vehicle Tax due upon purchase Imposto Sobre Veculos and the annual Circulation Tax Imposto nico de Circulao 2 Personal Income Tax provides an allowance of EUR 803 upon the purchase of EVs 3 EVs are fully exempt from the 5%-10% company car tax rates which are part of the Corporation Income Tax 4 The Budget Law provides for an increase of the depreciation costs related to the purchase of EVs for the purpose of Corporation Income Tax 5 the first 5,000 EVs to be sold in Portugal will receive a 5,000 incentive fund and the Cash-for-Clunkers program grants an additional 1,500 fund if an internal combustion engine vehicle built before 2000 is delivered when acquiring the new EV 6 The Portuguese State did also commit to play a pedagogic role and defined that EVs will have a 20% share of the annual renewal of public car fleet starting in 201 Spain Electric vehicles are the future and the driver of the industrial revolution Miguel Sebastin Spanish Industry Minister Spain s government aims to have 1 million electric cars on the roads by 2014 as part of a plan to cut energy consumption and dependence on expensive imports Industry Minister Miguel Sebastin sai
