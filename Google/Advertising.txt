10 pm and a total ban on advertisement for war toys In Europe and elsewhere there is a vigorous debate on whether or how much advertising to children should be regulate This debate was exacerbated by a report released by the Kaiser Family Foundation in February 2004 which suggested fast food advertising that targets children was an important factor in the epidemic of childhood obesity in the United State In New Zealand South Africa Canada and many European countries the advertising industry operates a system of self-regulatio Advertisers advertising agencies and the media agree on a code of advertising standards that they attempt to uphol The general aim of such codes is to ensure that any advertising is legal decent honest and truthful Some self-regulatory organizations are funded by the industry but remain independent with the intent of upholding the standards or codes like the Advertising Standards Authority in the U In the UK most forms of outdoor advertising such as the display of billboards is regulated by the UK Town and County Planning syste Currently the display of an advertisement without consent from the Planning Authority is a criminal offense liable to a fine of 2,500 per offenc All of the major outdoor billboard companies in the UK have convictions of this natur In the US many communities believe that many forms of outdoor advertising blight the public real As long ago as the 1960s in the US there were attempts to ban billboard advertising in the open countrysid Cities such as So Paulo have introduced an outright ban with London also having specific legislation to control unlawful display Many advertisers employ a wide-variety of linguistic devices to bypass regulatory laws e. In France printing English words in bold and French translations in fine print to deal with the Article 120 of the 1994 Toubon Law limiting the use of English The advertisement of controversial products such as cigarettes and condoms are subject to government regulation in many countrie For instance the tobacco industry is required by law in most countries to display warnings cautioning consumers about the health hazards of their product Linguistic variation is often used by advertisers as a creative device to reduce the impact of such requirement Advertising research Main article Advertising research Advertising research is a specialized form of research that works to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of advertisin It entails numerous forms of research which employ different methodologie Advertising research includes pre-testing also known as copy testing and post-testing of ads and/or campaignspre-testing is done before an ad airs to gauge how well it will perform and post-testing is done after an ad airs to determine the in-market impact of the ad or campaign on the consume Continuous ad tracking and the Communicus System are competing examples of post-testing advertising research type [ citation needed ] Semiotics Main article Advertising research Todays culture is made up of meanings between consumers and marketer These meanings depict signs and symbols that are encoded in everyday object Semiotics is the study of signs and how they are interprete Advertising has many hidden signs and meanings within brand names logos package designs print advertisements and television advertisements The purpose of semiotics is to study and interpret the message being conveyed in advertisements Logos and advertisements can be interpreted at two levels known as the surface level and the underlying leve The surface level uses signs creatively to create an image or personality for their produc These signs can be images words fonts colors or sloga The underlying level is made up of hidden meaning The combination of images words colors and slogan must be interpreted by the audience or consume The key to advertising analysis is the signifier and the signifie The signifier is the object and the signified is the mental concep A product has a signifier and a signifie The signifier is the color brand name logo design and technolog The signified has two meanings known as denotative and connotativ The denotative meaning is the meaning of the produc A televisions denotative meaning would be that it is high definitio The connotative meaning is the products deep and hidden meanin A connotative meaning of a television would be that it is top of the lin Apple is an excellent example of using semiotics in their advertising campaig Apples commercials used a black silhouette of a person that was the age of Apple s target marke They placed the silhouette in front of a blue screen so that the picture behind the silhouette could be constantly changin However the one thing that stays the same in these ads is that there is music in the background and the silhouette is listening to that music on a white iPod through white headphone Through advertising the white color on a set of earphones now signifies that the music device is an iPo The white color signifies almost all of Apples product The semiotics of gender plays a key influence on the way in which signs are interprete When considering gender roles in advertising individuals are influenced by three categorie Certain characteristics of stumuli may enhance or decrease the elaboration of the message if the product is perceived as feminine or masculine Second the characteristics of individuals can affect attention and elaboration of the message traditional or non-traditional gender role orientation Lastly situational factors may be important to influence the elaboration of the message There are two types of marketing communication claims-objective and subjectiv Objective claims stem from the extent to which the claim associates the brand with a tangible product or service featur For instance the camera has auto focus feature Subjective claims convey emotional subjective impressions of intangible aspects of a product or servic They are non-physical features of a product or service that cannot be directly perceived as they have no physical reality For instance the brochure has a beautiful design Males tend to respond better to objective marketing communications claims while females tend to respond better to subjective marketing communications claim In advertisements men are represented as independen They are shown in more occupations than wome Women are represented mainly as housewives and mother Men are more likely to be shown advertising cars or business products while women advertise domestic product Men are more likely to be shown outdoors or in business setting Women are depicted in domestic setting Men are more often portrayed as authoritie As far as ads go with age men seem to gain wisdom and authorit On the other hand women seem to disappear with ag Voiceovers are commonly used in advertisin Most voiceovers are men figures of up to 94% have been reported There have been more female voiceovers in recent years but mainly for food household products and feminine care product Gender effects in the processing of advertising According to a 1977 study by David Statt females process information comprehensively while males process information through heuristic devices such as procedures methods or strategies for solving problems which could have an effect on how they interpret advertisin According to this study men prefer to have available and apparent cues to interpret the message where females engage in more creative associative imagery-laced interpretatio More recently research by Martin 2003 reveals that males and females differ in how they react to advertising depending on their mood at the time of exposure to the ads and the affective tone of the advertisin When feeling sad males prefer happy ads to boost their moo In contrast females prefer happy ads when they are feeling happ The television programs in which the ads are embedded are shown to influence a consumer s mood stat See also Business and economics portal Ad server Advertising to children Bibliography
