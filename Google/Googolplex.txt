In pure mathematics the magnitude of a googolplex could be related to other forms of large-number notation such as tetration Knuth s up-arrow notation Steinhaus-Moser notation or Conway chained arrow

coined the term googol which is then proposed the further term googolplex to be one followed by writing zeroes until you get tired Kasner decided to adopt a more formal definition because different people get tired at different times and it would never do to have Carnera be a better mathematician than D Einstein simply because he had more endurance and could write for longer It thus became standardized to Size In the PBS science program Cosmos A Personal Voyage Episode 9 The Lives of the Stars astronomer and television personality Carl Sagan estimated that writing a googolplex in standard form i.e. 10,000,000,000. would be physically impossible since doing so would require more space than the known universe provide An average book of 60 cubic inches can be printed with 5 10 5 zeroes 5 characters per word 10 words per line 25 lines per page 400 pages or 8.3 10 3 zeros per cubic inc The observable i. past light cone universe contains 6 10 83 cubic inches 4 3 14 10 9 light years in inches 3 This math implies that if the universe is stuffed with paper printed with 0s it could contain only 5.3 10 87 zerosfar short of a googol of zero In fact there are only about 2.5 10 89 elementary particles in the observable universe so even if one were to use an elementary particle to represent each digit one would run out of particles well before reaching a googol of digit Consider printing the digits of a googolplex in unreadable one- point font 0.353mm per digit It would take about 3.5 10 96 metres to write a googolplex in one-point fon The observable universe is estimated to be 8.80 10 26 meters or 93 billion light-years in diameter so the distance required to write the necessary zeroes is 4.0 10 69 times as long as the estimated univers The time it would take to write such a number also renders the task implausible if a person can write two digits per second it would take around about 1.51 10 92 years which is about 1.1 10 82 times the age of the universe to write a googolple A Planck space has a volume of a Planck length cubed which is the smallest measurable volume at approximately 4.222 10 105 m 3 = 4.222 10 99 cm 3 Thus 2.5cm 3 contain about a googol Planck space There are only about 3 10 80 cubic metres in the observable universe giving about 7.1 10 184 Planck spaces in the entire observable universe so a googolplex is far larger than even the number of the smallest measurable spaces in the observable univers Scale In pure mathematics In pure mathematics the magnitude of a googolplex could be related to other forms of large-number notation such as tetration Knuth s up-arrow notation Steinhaus-Moser notation or Conway chained arrow notation though neither googol nor googolplex are anywhere near the largest representable or even specifically named number For example Graham s number though finite is unimaginably larger than other well-known large numbers such as a googol googolplex and even larger than Skewes number and Moser s number Indeed the observable universe is far too small to contain an ordinary digital representation of Graham s number assuming that each digit occupies at least one Planck volume In the physical universe One Googol is presumed to be greater than the number of hydrogen atoms in the observable universe which has been variously estimated to be between 10 79 and 10 81 A googol is also greater than the number of Planck times elapsed since the Big Bang which is estimated at about 8 10 60 Thus in the physical world it is difficult to give examples of numbers that compare to the vastly greater googolple In analyzing quantum states and black holes physicist Don Page writes that determining experimentally whether or not information is lost down black holes of solar mass would require more than measurements to give a rough determination of the final density matrix after a black hole evaporates The end of the Universe via Big Freeze without proton decay is suspected to be years into the future which is still short of a googolple In a separate article Page shows that the number of states in a black hole with a mass roughly equivalent to the Andromeda Galaxy is in the range of a googolple If the entire volume of the observable universe taken to be 3 10 80 m 3 were packed solid with fine dust particles about 1.5 micrometres in size then the number of different ways of ordering these particles that is assigning the number 1 to one particle then the number 2 to another particle and so on until all particles are numbered would be approximately one googolple [ citation needed ]
