External links History Founding National Semiconductor was founded in Danbury Connecticut by D Bernard J Rothlein on May 27 1959 when he and seven colleagues had left their employment at the semiconductor division of Sperry Rand Corporation The founding of the new company was followed by Sperry Rand filing a lawsuit against National Semiconductor for patent infringemen By 1965 as it was reaching the courts the preliminaries of the lawsuit had caused the stock value of National to be depresse The depressed stock values allowed Peter J Sprague to invest heavily in the company with Sprague s family fund Sprague also relied on further financial backing from a pair of west coast investment firms and a New York underwriter to take control as the Chairman of National Semiconducto At that time Sprague was 27 years ol Jeffrey S Young characterised the era as the beginning of venture capitalism That same year National Semiconductor acquired Molectr Molectro was founded in 1962 in Santa Clara California by Nall and Spittlehouse who were formerly employed at Fairchild Camera and Instrument Corporatio The acquisition also brought to National Semiconductor two experts in linear semiconductor technologies Dave Talbert and Robert Widlar who were also formerly employed at Fairchil The acquisition of Molectro provided National with the technology to launch itself in the fabrication and manufacture of monolithic integrated circuit In 1967 Sprague hired five top executives away from Fairchild among whom were Charles E Sporck and Pierre Lamond At the time of Sporck s hiring Robert Noyce was defacto head of semiconductor operations at Fairchild and Sporck was his operations manage Charles E Sporck was appointed President and CEO of Nationa To make the deal better for Sporck s hiring and appointment for half his former salary at Fairchild Sporck was alloted a substantial share of National s stoc In essence Sporck took four of his personnel from Fairchild with him as well as three others from TI Perkin-Elmer and Hewlett Packard to form a new eight man team at National Semiconducto Incidentally Sporck had been Widlar s superior at Fairchild before Widlar left Fairchild to join Molectro due to a compensation dispute with Sporc In 1968 National shifted its headquarters from Danbury Connecticut to Santa Clara California However not unlike many companies for legal and financial expediency National retained its registration as a Delaware corporation Over the years they acquired several companies like Fairchild Semiconductor in 1987 and Cyrix in 1997 However over time National Semiconductor spun off these acquisition Fairchild Semiconductor became a separate company again in 1997 the Cyrix microprocessors division was sold to VIA Technologies of Taiwan in 199 From 1997 to 2002 National enjoyed a large amount of publicity and awards with the development of the Cyrix Media Center Cyrix WebPad WebPad Metro and National Origami PDA concept devices created by National s Conceptual Products Group Based largely on the success of the WebPad National formed the Information Appliance division highly integrated processors internet gadgets in 199 The Information Appliance Division was sold to AMD in 200 Other business like digital wireless chipsets image sensors PC I/O chipsets have also been recently closed down or sold off as National has reincarnated itself as a high performance analog semiconductor compan The transformation of National Semiconductor Peter Sprague Pierre Lamond and the affectionately called Charlie Sporck worked hand-in-hand and with support of the board of directors to transform the company into a multinational and world-class semiconductor concer Immediately after becoming CEO Sporck started an historic price war among semiconductor companies which then trimmed the number of competitors in the fiel Among the casualties to exit the semiconductor business were General Electric and Westinghous Cost control overhead reduction and a focus on profits implemented by Sporck was the key element to National surviving the price war and subsequently in 1981 becoming the first semiconductor company to reach the US$1 billion annual sales mar However the foundation that made National successful was its expertise in analogue electronics TTL transistortransistor logic and MOSFET metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor integrated circuit technologie As they had while employed in Fairchild - Sporck and Lamond directed National Semiconductor towards the growing industrial and commercial markets and to rely less on military and aerospace contract Those decisions coupled with inflationary growth in use of computers provided the market for the expansion of Nationa Meanwhile sources of funds associated with Sprague coupled with creative structuring of cash flow buffering due to Sporck and Lamond provided the financing required for that expansio Lamond and Sporck had also managed to attract and extract substantial funds to finance the expansio Among Sporck s cost control efforts was his attraction towards low-cost labour and outsourcing of labou National Semiconductor was among the pioneers in the semiconductor industry to invest in facilities to perform final manufacturing operations of integrated circuits in developing countries especially in Southeast Asi National Semiconductor s manufacturing improvements under Sporck in collaboration with Lamond had not been enabled by emphasis on process innovation but on improving and standardising processes already established by other companies like Fairchild and Texas Instrument As well as by frequent raiding to hire from Fairchild s pool of talent Sporck and Lamond directed the company towards exploiting the growing commercial and industrial applications market thus lessening dependence on competing for military and aerospace contract Weaknesses of Sporck s leadership National Semiconductor under Sporck was not particularly invested in marketing strategies even though it had the vision to launch itself into new and apparent opportunities in the consumer marke Sporck had applied strategies that made National Semiconductor function as a low-cost mass manufacturer of semiconductor commoditie It seems that companies like Sony of Japan and Swatch of Switzerland understood that the consumer market is much less a commodities market where low cost of products does not always equal demand for such product A few key executives and engineers left the company in 198 Among them was Pierre Lamond who had been the chief IC designer now partner at Sequoia Capital Robert Swanson s leaving the company in the same year to found Linear Technology was another indication of the appropriateness of organisational strategies of National Semiconductor under Sporc For 13 of 14 years at National I was a gung-ho gu Then the company started to get bi I kept looking at all the companies whose butts we d been kickin And then National started organizing itself like the It was frustratin Swanson said in the May 13 1991 Business Journal-San Jos Sporck s strategy of outsourcing sales to external sources meant National Semiconductor did not have sufficient or responsive resources to respond to requests from innovators inventors and academic research - which would have been helpful in the technological innovation boom of the 1980 National Semiconductor s lack and loss of innovation meant it was producing products that were easily copied and reproducibl It may have been the cheapest manufacturer in the United States but it was not the cheapest compared to the Asian manufacturer This weakness in National Semiconductor was evident in its failure to compete during the globalisation of Japanese semiconductor companies in the 1980s followed by the Taiwanese and South Korean Leadership under Gilbert F Amelio On 1991 May 27 Charles E Sporck was replaced by Gilbert Amelio as CEO and presiden Amelio was then president of Rockwell International s semiconductor division and had a Ph. in physics from Georgia Institute of Technology Amelio had also been formerly employed at Fairchil Amelio was faced with a company plagued with over-capacity and shrinking market shar Amelio found that just prior to his taking helm despite having spent US$1 billion over the last five years on research and development National Semiconductor had a disappointing record in new product The Business section of The New York Times January 11 1991 reflected the over-capacity generated by Sporck that had to be inherited by Ameli Amelio disposed off the non-core products and assets in which National Semiconductor had no market motivation or expertise and turned the company towards its core expertise - analogue semiconductor National Semiconductor under Amelio emphasized on reduction of cost of sales improving capacity utilization scrap reduction and cycle-time reductio Redundant facilities were sold and consolidate With the progress of restructuring National Semiconductor had revenues increased with each yea In 1994 National Semiconductor under Amelio posted record net revenues of US$2.29 billio It was also a time when US semiconductor companies had regained market leadershi Amelio introduced benchmarking to evaluate productivity restructured marketing strategies and reorganised management by introducing modern management practices and workplace environment Amelio divided products into two divisions Standard Products group which comprises low-margin logic and memory chips - commodity products which were more susceptible to cyclical demands and through which National Semiconductor had matured and Communications Computing group which comprises high-margin value-added analogue and mixed-signal chip Amelio s thus division of products seemed to prepare National Semiconductor for the eventual disposal of low-margin commodity products which came to fruition later with the sale of a reconstituted Fairchil National Semiconductor under Amelio chose to build a brand new eight inch 200mm wafer fabrication plant in South Portland Main It chose to divest itself from its then somewhat new plant in Migdal Ha Emeq Israe In 1995 Amelio was elected to be the chairman of the board of directors of National Semiconducto In 1996 Amelio accepted invitation from Apple Computer a customer of National Semiconductor to join its board of director Troubles at Apple later prompted the board to invite Amelio to take on the position of CEO which he accepted in February 199 National Semiconductor announced the resignation of Amelio as the company s President Chairman and Chief Executive Officer on February 2 199 Leadership Under Brian Halla National Semiconductor announced the appointment of Brian Halla as its chairman president and CEO on May 3 199 Halla was then the head of LSI logic products divisio Prior to LSI he had been with Intel for 14 year Halla reinforced Amelio s emphasis on the expertise of National Semiconductor in analogue technolog He also was on occasions an evangelist for analogue technolog However he found that National Semiconductor under Amelio had insufficient product offering Halla embarked on a diversification into personal computer and graphics busines He advocated PC-on-a-chip aka system-on-a-chip as a business direction for National Semiconducto During his tenure at LSI LSI had successfully applied similar concept However LSI had steered clear of getting involved with PC technologies that would make it a competitor with Inte Halla held the vision that information appliances IAs would succeed the personal computer as a tren He predicted that IAs would overtake sales of PCs by the year 200 To achieve the goal National Semiconductor started acquiring companies that would provide the technological complements to do s Among the acquisitions were Cirrus Logic Inc s PicoPower business for its specialised expertise in small form factor devices Mediamatics Inc which makes multimedia connectivity products Future Integrated Systems Inc a PC graphics company Gulbransen Inc a digital audio technology maker ComCore Semiconductor Inc a maker of digital signal processing for LANs Cyrix the maker of Intel x86 clone On March 11 1997 National Semiconductor Corporation announced the US$550 million sale of a reconstituted Fairchild to the management of Fairchild with the backing of Sterling LLC a unit of Citicorp Venture Capita Fairchild carried with it what was mostly the Standard Products group previously segregated by Ameli Incidentally the effective price of acquisition of Cyrix was also US$550 millio On November 17 1997 National Semiconductor and Cyrix announced the merger of the companie Cyrix would become an autonomous wholly owned subsidiar Halla had earlier emphasized that National was after the low-end CPU market as part of the system-on-a-chip pursuit and therefore would not place emphasis on Cyrix s current development of high-end 6x86MX desig However Cyrix later announced that its merger with National Semiconductor would not change its development or marketing plan The acquisition of an independent-minded Cyrix subsequently turned National Semiconductor from a collaborator into a competitor with Inte National lost its business with Inte Intel reinstated the relationship after the sale of Cyri The acquisition of Cyrix also carried with it a business obligation as well as technical constraints to use IBM microelectronics division to fabricate the Cyrix chips while National Semiconductor had plans to transfer their fabrication to its South Portland fa National incurred huge losses due to its processor business and announced the sale of Cyrix to VIA in 199 In 1999 National Semiconductor also put out feelers that it would sell if not the whole then a majority stake of its fabrication plant in South Portland Main However that did not come to fruitio On June 28 2000 National Semiconductor and TSMC Taiwan signed an agreement that would allow transfer of advanced fabrication technologies from TSMC to the National Semiconductor fabrication plant in South Portland Main On March 11 2009 National announced plans to close its assembly and test plant in Suzhou China and its wafer fabrication plant in Arlington Texa On October 9 2009 Brian Halla announced his retirement as Nationals CE He remains executive chairma The company promoted Donald Don Macleod who had previously served as the companys president and chief operating officer to CE Leadership under Donald Macleod Don Macleod became National Semiconductors chief executive officer on November 30 200 He was named chairman of the board on May 31 201 Acquisition by Texas Instruments Further information Texas Instruments On April 4 2011 Texas Instruments announced that it had agreed to buy National Semiconductor for $6.5 billion in cas Texas Instruments paid $25 per share of National Semiconductor stock an 80% premium over the April 4 2011 closing share price of $14.0 The deal made Texas Instruments one of the world s largest makers of
