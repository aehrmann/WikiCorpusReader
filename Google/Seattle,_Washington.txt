608,660 residents as of the 2010 Census Seattle is the largest city in the Pacific Northwest region of North America and the largest city on the West Coast north of San Francisco The Seattle metropolitan area of about 3.4million inhabitants is the 15th largest metropolitan area in the United State The city is situated on a narrow isthmus between Puget Sound an arm of the Pacific Ocean and Lake Washington about 114 miles 183km south of the CanadaUnited States border yet on a more northern latitude than Toronto In 2010 the container ports in the Seattle metropolitan area Seattle-Tacoma were the third busiest in the United States after Los AngelesLong Beach and New YorkNew Jersey serving as a major gateway for trade with Asi In terms of percentage Seattle has the second-largest gay lesbian or bisexual population among major US citie The Seattle area had been inhabited by Native Americans for at least 4,000 years before the first permanent white settler Arthur Denny and his group of travelers subsequently known as the Denny Party arrived at Alki Point on November 13 185 The settlement was moved to its current site and named Seattle in 1853 after Chief Si ahl of the local Duwamish and Suquamish tribe Logging was Seattle s first major industry but by the late 19th century the city had become a commercial and shipbuilding center as a gateway to Alaska during the Klondike Gold Rush By 1910 Seattle was one of the 25 largest cities in the countr However the Great Depression severely damaged the city s econom Growth returned during and after World War II due partially to the local Boeing company which established Seattle as a center for aircraft manufacturin The city developed as a technology center in the 1980 The stream of new software biotechnology and internet companies led to an economic revival which increased the city s population by 50,000 between 1990 and 200 More recently Seattle has become a hub for green industry and a model for sustainable development Seattle has a noteworthy musical histor From 1918 to 1951 there were nearly two dozen jazz nightclubs along Jackson Street in the current Chinatown/International Distric The jazz scene developed the early careers of Ray Charles Quincy Jones Ernestine Anderson and other Seattle is also the birthplace of rock legend Jimi Hendrix and the rock music style known as grunge which was made

Seattle The Battle of Seattle 1856 Founding Archaeological excavations suggest that humans have inhabited the Seattle area for at least 4,000 year By the time the first European settlers arrived in the area the people subsequently called the Duwamish tribe occupied at least seventeen villages in the areas around Elliott Bay The first European to visit the Seattle area was George Vancouver in May 1792 during his 179195 expedition to chart the Pacific Northwest In 1851 a large party led by Luther Collins made a location on land at the mouth of the Duwamish River they formally claimed it on September 14 185 Thirteen days later members of the Collins Party on the way to their claim passed three scouts of the Denny Part Members of the Denny Party claimed land on Alki Point on September 28 185 The rest of the Denny Party set sail from Portland Oregon and landed on Alki point during a rainstorm on November 13 185 First Avenue at Columbia Street 1870 After a difficult winter most of the Denny Party relocated across Elliott Bay and founded the village of Dewamps or Duwamps on the site of present day Pioneer Square Charles Terry and John Low remained at the original landing location and established a village they initially called New York but renamed New York Alki in April 1853 from a Chinook word meaning roughly by and by or someday For the next few years New York Alki and Duwamps competed for dominance but in time Alki was abandoned and its residents moved across the bay to join the rest of the settler David Swinson Doc Maynard one of Duwamps s founders was the primary advocate to rename the village Seattle after Chief Sealth Seattle of the Duwamish and Suquamish tribe The name Seattle appears on official Washington Territory papers dated May 23 1853 when the first plats for the village were file In 1855 nominal land settlements were establishe On January 14 1865 the Legislature of Territorial Washington incorporated the Town of Seattle with a board of trustees managing the cit The town of Seattle remained a mere precinct of King County until late 1869 when a new petition was filed and the city was re-incorporated with a Mayor-council government The corporate seal of the City of Seattle carries the date 186 Seattle s first streetcar at the corner of Occidental and Yesler 188 All of the buildings visible in this picture were destroyed by fire five years late Timber town Seattle has a history of boom and bust cycles as is common to cities near areas of extensive natural and mineral resource Seattle has risen several times economically then gone into precipitous decline but it has typically used those periods to rebuild solid infrastructur The first such boom covering the early years of the city was fueled by the lumber industr During this period the road now known as Yesler Way was nicknamed Skid Road after the timber skidding down the hill to Henry Yesler s sawmil This is considered a possible origin for the term which later entered the wider American lexicon as Skid Row Like much of the American West Seattle saw numerous conflicts between labor and management as well as ethnic tensions that culminated in the anti-Chinese riots of 18851886 This violence was caused by unemployed whites who determined to drive the Chinese from Seattle anti-Chinese riots also occurred in Tacoma In 1900 Asians were 4.2% of the populatio Martial law was declared and federal troops were brought in to put down the disorde Nevertheless the economic success in the Seattle area was so great that when the Great Seattle fire of 1889 destroyed the central business district a far grander city center rapidly emerged in its plac Finance company Washington Mutual for example was founded in the immediate wake of the fir This boom was followed by the construction of a park system designed by the Olmsted brothers landscape architecture fir However the Panic of 1893 hit Seattle har Gold Rush World War I and the Great Depression The Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition had just over 3.7million visitors during its 138-day run The second and most dramatic boom and bust resulted from the Klondike Gold Rush which ended the depression that had begun with the Panic of 1893 in a short time Seattle became a major transportation cente On July 14 1897 the S. Portland docked with its famed ton of gold and Seattle became the main transport and supply point for the miners in Alaska and the Yuko Few of those working men found lasting wealth however it was Seattle s business of clothing the miners and feeding them salmon that panned out in the long ru Along with Seattle other cities like Everett Tacoma Port Townsend Bremerton and Olympia all in the Puget Sound region became competitors for exchange rather than mother lodes for extraction of precious metal The boom lasted well into the early part of the 20th century and funded many new Seattle companies and product In 1907 19-year-old James Casey borrowed $100 from a friend and founded the American Messenger Company later UPS Other Seattle companies founded during this period include Nordstrom and Eddie Bauer The Gold Rush era culminated in the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition of 1909 which is largely responsible for the layout of today s University of Washington campu Pioneer Square in 1917 featuring the Smith Tower the Seattle Hotel and to the left the Pioneer Building A shipbuilding boom in the early part of the 20th century became massive during World War I making Seattle somewhat of a company town the subsequent retrenchment led to the Seattle General Strike of 1919 the first general strike in the countr A 1912 city development plan by Virgil Bogue went largely unuse Seattle was mildly prosperous in the 1920s but was particularly hard hit in the Great Depression experiencing some of the country s harshest labor strife in that er Violence during the Maritime Strike of 1934 cost Seattle much of its maritime traffic which was rerouted to the Port of Los Angeles Seattle was also the home base of impresario Alexander Pantages who starting in 1902 opened a number of theaters in the city exhibiting vaudeville acts and silent movie His activities soon expanded and the thrifty Greek went on and became one of America s greatest theater and movie tycoon Between Pantages and his rival John Considine Seattle was for a while the western United States vaudeville mecc Marcus Priteca the Scottish -born and Seattle-based architect built several theaters for Pantages including some in Seattl The theaters he built for Pantages in Seattle have been either demolished or converted to other uses but many other theaters survive in other cities of the U.S. often retaining the Pantages name Seattle s surviving Paramount Theatre on which he collaborated was not a Pantages theate Post-war years aircraft and software Building the Seattle Center Monorail 196 Looking up Fifth Avenue from Virginia Stree War work again brought local prosperity during World War II this time centered on Boeing aircraf The war dispersed the city s numerous Japanese-American businessmen due to the Japanese American internment After war the local economy dippe It rose again with Boeing s growing dominance in the commercial airliner marke Seattle celebrated its restored prosperity and made a bid for world recognition with the Century 21 Exposition the 1962 World s Fair Another major local economic downturn was in the late 1960s and early 1970 Many people left the area to look for work elsewhere and two local real estate agents put up a billboard reading Will the last person leaving Seattle Turn out the light Seattle remained the corporate headquarters of Boeing until 2001 when the company separated its headquarters from its major production facilities the headquarters were moved to Chicag The Seattle area is still home to Boeing s

for employees BECU remains based in the Seattle area though it is now open to all residents of Washingto Downtown Seattle and a ferry at the Central Waterfron As prosperity began to return in the 1980s the city was stunned by the Wah Mee massacre in 1983 when 13 people were killed in an illegal gambling club in the International District Seattle s Chinatown Beginning with Microsoft s 1979 move from Albuquerque New Mexico to nearby Bellevue Washington Seattle and its suburbs became home to a number of technology companies including Amazon.com RealNetworks McCaw Cellular now part of ATT Mobility VoiceStream now T-Mobile USA and biomedical corporations such as HeartStream later purchased by Philips Heart Technologies later purchased by Boston Scientific Physio-Control later purchased by Medtronic ZymoGenetics ICOS later purchased by Eli Lilly and Company and Immunex later purchased by Amgen This success brought an influx of new citizens with a population increase within city limits of almost 50,000 between 1990 and 2000 and saw Seattle s real estate become some of the most expensive in the countr Many of the Seattle area s tech companies remain relatively strong but the frenzied dot-com boom years ended in early 200 Seattle in this period attracted widespread attention as home to these many companies but also by hosting the 1990 Goodwill Games and the APEC leaders conference in 1993 as well as through the worldwide popularity of grunge a sound that had developed in Seattle s independent music scen Another bid for worldwide attentionhosting the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999 garnered visibility but not in the way its sponsors desired as related protest activity and police reactions to those protests overshadowed the conference

firmly in the Oceanic zone Do like much of Western Europ Temperature extremes are moderated by the adjacent Puget Sound greater Pacific Ocean and Lake Washingto The region is largely denied Pacific storms by the Olympic Mountains and Arctic air by the Cascade Rang Despite being on the margin of the rain shadow of the Olympic Mountains the city has a reputation for frequent rai This reputation stems from the frequency of precipitation in the fall winter and sprin In an average year more than 0.3mm 0.01in of precipitation falls on 150 day It is cloudy 201 days out of the year and partly cloudy 93 day The location of official weather and climatic records the Seattle-Tacoma International Airport is located about 19km 12miles south of downtown in the city of SeaTac and records more cloudy days and fewer partly cloudy days per yea For this reason official weather and climatic records do not actually reflect the weather and climate conditions of the city prope At 944mm 37.49 i in

Florida 1304mm/51.34 i and most cities on the Eastern Seaboard of the U. These stats may be slightly misleading however as Seattle proper gets less rain than the region as a whol Bremerton 15 miles SW of Seattle and Issaquah 15 miles SE of Seattle both receive 65 inches of rainfall annually which means that some cities in the Seattle metro area would be considered the rainiest cities in the continental U. Surprisingly Seattle proper was not listed in a study that revealed the 10 rainiest cities in the continental United State This is due largely to Seattle s dry summers which result in statistically moderate annual accumulations and its position on the eastern banks of the Puget Sound which result in Seattle receiving less precipitation than other cities in the metro are However the city is becoming wetter the current annual rainfall average of 952 millimeters reflects an increase of 11m Seattle receives the largest amount of rainfall of any U. city of more than 250,000 people in

Bellevue and Issaquah are typically even hotter when the temperature soars above 80 F 27C due to their location closer to downslope winds from the Cascade Mountains and further from Puget Sound on Seattle s recorded hottest day of July 29 2009 parts of south Bellevue Renton and Issaquah peaked at 110 F 43C Eighty miles 130km to the west the Hoh Rain Forest in Olympic National Park on the

from the north meets air flowing in from the sout Both streams of air originate over the Pacific Ocean airflow is split by the Olympic Mountains to Seattle s west then reunited to the eas When the air currents meet they are forced upward resulting in convection Thunderstorms caused by this activity can occur north and south of town but Seattle itself rarely receives more weather than occasional thunder and small hail shower The Hanukkah Eve Wind Storm in December 2006 is an exception that brought heavy rain and winds gusting up to 69mph 111km/h not caused by the Puget Sound Convergence Zon One of many exceptions to Seattle s reputation as a damp location occurs in El Nio years when marine weather systems track as far south as California and little precipitation falls in the Puget Sound are Since the region s water comes from mountain snow packs during the dry summer months El Nio winters can not only produce substandard skiing but can result in water rationing and a shortage of

six incorporated towns and areas of unincorporated King County including Southeast Seattle Ravenna South Park Columbia City Ballard and West Seattle Three years later after having difficulties paying a $10,000bill from the county the city of Georgetown merged with Seattl Finally on January 4 1954 the area between 85th Street and 145th Street was annexed including the neighborhoods of Pinehurst Greenwood Blue Ridge Crown Hill Broadview Bitter Lake Haller Lake Maple Leaf Lake City View Ridge and Northgate Former Seattle mayor Greg Nickels is among those who have called Seattle a city of neighborhoods although the boundaries and even names of those neighborhoods are often open to disput For example a Department of Neighborhoods spokeswoman reported that her own neighborhood has gone from the CD Central District to Madrona to Greater Madison Valley and now Madrona Park Over a dozen Seattle neighborhoods have Neighborhood Service Centers originally known in 1972 as Little City Halls and even more have their own street fair and/or parade during the summer month The largest of the city s street fairs feature hundreds of craft and food booths and multiple stages with live entertainment and draw more than 100,000people over the course of a weeken In addition at least half a dozen neighborhoods have weekly farmers markets some with as many as fifty vendor Additionally Puget Sound Regional Council designates several areas of Seattle as urban centers defined as designated planning districts intended to provide a mix of housing employment and commercial and cultural
