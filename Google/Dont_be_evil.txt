 Don t be evil is the informal corporate motto or slogan of Google originally suggested by Google employees Paul Buchheit and Amit Patel at a meetin Buchheit the creator of Gmail said he wanted something that once you put it in there would be hard to take out adding that the slogan was also a bit of a jab at a lot of the other companies especially our competitors who at the time in our opinion were kind of exploiting the users to some exten While the official corporate philosophy of Google does not contain the words Don t be evil they were included in the prospectus aka S-1 of Google s 2004 IPO a letter from Google s founders later called the Don t Be Evil manifesto Dont be evi We believe strongly that in the long term we will be better served as shareholders and in all other ways by a company that does good things for the world even if we forgo some short term gain The sixth point of the 10-point corporate philosophy of Google says You can make money without doing evi The motto is sometimes incorrectly stated as Do no evil Don t be evil is said to recognize that large corporations often maximize short-term profits with actions that may not be in the best interests of the publi Supposedly by instilling a don t-be-evil culture the corporation establishes a baseline for honest decision-making that disassociates Google from any and all cheatin This in turn can enhance the trust and image of the corporation which may outweigh short-term gains from violating the Don t Be Evil principle [ citation needed ] While many companies have ethical codes to govern their conduct Google claims to have made Don t Be Evil a central pillar of their identity and part of their self-proclaimed core value Criticism of Google often includes a reference to Don t be evil Avoiding conflicts of interest In their 2004 founders letter prior to their initial public offering Larry Page and Sergey Brin explained that their Don t be evil culture prohibited conflicts of interest and required objectivity and an absence of bias Google users trust our systems to help them with important decisions medical financial and many other Our search results are the best we know how to produc They are unbiased and objective and we do not accept payment for them or for inclusion or more frequent updatin We also display advertising which we work hard to make relevant and we label it clearl This is similar to a well-run newspaper where the advertisements are clear and the articles are not influenced by the advertisers payment We believe it is important for everyone to have access to the best information and research not only to the information people pay for you to se Chris Hoofnagle director of University of California at Berkeley Laws information privacy programs has stated that Google s original intention expressed by the don t be evil motto is linked to the company s separation of search results from advertisin However he argues that clearly separating search results from sponsored links is required by law thus Google s practice is now mainstream and no longer remarkable or goo According to Hoofnagle Google should abandon the motto because The evil talk is not only an albatross for Google it obscures the substantial consumer benefits from Googles advertising mode Because we have forgotten the original context of Googles evil representations the company should remind the public of the companys contribution to a revolution in search advertising and highlight some overlooked benefits of their mode See also Evil corporation Googlization References Investor Google Retrieved 2011-11-25 Paul Buchheit on Gmail AdSense and More Blogoscope 2007-01-25 Retrieved 2011-11-25 Don t Be Evil or don t lose value?
