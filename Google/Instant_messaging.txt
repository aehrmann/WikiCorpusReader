Celerity BBS also used a similar interfac Modern implementations of real-time text also exist in instant messengers such as AOL s Real-Time IM as an optional featur In the latter half of the 1980s and into the early 1990s the Quantum Link online service for Commodore 64 computers offered user-to-user messages between concurrently connected customers which they called On-Line Messages or OLM for short and later FlashMai Quantum Link later became America Online and made AOL Instant Messenger AIM discussed later While the Quantum Link service ran on a Commodore 64 using only the Commodore s PETSCII text-graphics the screen was visually divided into sections and OLMs would appear as a yellow bar saying Message From and the name of the sender along with the message across the top of whatever the user was already doing and presented a list of options for respondin As such it could be considered a type of graphical user interface GUI albeit much more primitive than the later Unix Windows and Macintosh based GUI IM softwar OLMs were what Q-Link called Plus Services meaning they charged an extra per-minute fee on top of the monthly Q-Link access cost Modern Internet-wide GUI-based messaging clients as they are known today began to take off in the mid 1990s with PowWow ICQ and AOL Instant Messenger Similar functionality was offered by CU-SeeMe in 1992 though primarily an audio/video chat link users could also send textual messages to each othe AOL later acquired Mirabilis the authors of ICQ a few years later ICQ now owned by AOL was awarded two patents for instant messaging by the U. patent offic Meanwhile other companies developed their own software Excite MSN Ubique and Yahoo! each with its own proprietary protocol and client users therefore had to run multiple client applications if they wished to use more than one of these network In 1998 IBM released IBM Lotus Sametime a product based on technology acquired when IBM bought Haifa-based Ubique and Lexington-based Databea In 2000 an open source application and open standards -based protocol called Jabber was launche The protocol was standardized under the name Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol XMPP XMPP servers could act as gateways to other IM protocols reducing the need to run multiple client Multi-protocol clients can use any of the popular IM protocols by using additional local libraries for each protoco IBM Lotus Sametime s November 2007 release added IBM Lotus Sametime Gateway support for XMP As of 2010 social networking providers often offer IM abilitie Facebook Chat is a form of instant messaging and Twitter can be thought of as a Web 2.0 instant messaging syste Many instant messaging services offer video calling features voice over IP and web conferencing service Web conferencing services can integrate both video calling and instant messaging abilitie Some instant messaging companies are also offering desktop sharing IP radio and IPTV to the voice and video feature The term Instant Messenger is a service mark of Time Warner and may not be used in software not affiliated with AOL in the United State For this reason in April 2007 the instant messaging client formerly named Gaim or gaim announced that they would be renamed Pidgin Clients This section needs additional citations for verification January 2012 Each modern IM service generally provides its own client either a separately installed piece of software or a browser-based clien These usually only work with the supplier company s service although some allow limited function with other service Third party client software applications exist that will connect with most of the major IM service Adium Empathy Meebo Miranda IM Pidgin Qnext and Trillian are a few of the common one Interoperability This section needs additional citations for verification January 2012 Pidgin s tabbed chat window in Linux Standard complementary instant messaging applications offer functions like file transfer contact list s the ability to hold several simultaneous conversations et These may be all the functions that a small business needs but larger organizations will require more sophisticated applications that can work togethe The solution to finding applications capable of this is to use enterprise versions of instant messaging application These include titles like XMPP Lotus Sametime Microsoft Office Communicator etc. which are often integrated with other enterprise applications such as workflow system These enterprise applications or enterprise application integration EAI are built to certain constraints namely storing data in a common forma There have been several attempts to create a unified standard for instant messaging IETF s Session Initiation Protocol SIP and SIP for Instant Messaging and Presence Leveraging Extensions SIMPLE Application Exchange APEX Instant Messaging and Presence Protocol IMPP the open XML -based Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol XMPP and Open Mobile Alliance s Instant Messaging and Presence Service developed specifically for mobile device Most attempts at producing a unified standard for the major IM providers AOL Yahoo! and Microsoft have failed and each continues to use its own proprietary protocol However while discussions at IETF were stalled Reuters signed the first inter-service provider connectivity agreement on September 200 This agreement enabled AIM ICQ and MSN Messenger users to talk with Reuters Messaging counterparts and vice-vers Following this Microsoft Yahoo! and AOL agreed to a deal in which Microsoft s Live Communications Server 2005 users would also have the possibility to talk to public instant messaging user This deal established SIP/SIMPLE as a standard for protocol interoperability and established a connectivity fee for accessing public instant messaging groups or service Separately on October 13 2005 Microsoft and Yahoo! announced that by the 3rd quarter of 2006 they would interoperate using SIP/SIMPLE which was followed in December 2005 by the AOL and Google strategic partnership deal in which Google Talk users would be able to communicate with AIM and ICQ users provided they have an AIM accoun There are two ways to combine the many disparate protocols Combine the many disparate protocols inside the IM client application Combine the many disparate protocols inside the IM server applicatio This approach moves the task of communicating with the other services to the serve Clients need not know or care about other IM protocol For example LCS 2005 Public IM Connectivit This approach is popular in XMPP servers however the so-called transport projects suffer the same reverse engineering difficulties as any other project involved with closed protocols or format Some approaches allow organizations to deploy their own private instant messaging network by enabling them to restrict access to the server often with the IM network entirely behind their firewall and administer user permission Other corporate messaging systems allow registered users to also connect from outside the corporation LAN by using an encrypted firewall-friendly HTTPS-based protoco Usually a dedicated corporate IM server has several advantages such as pre-populated contact lists integrated authentication and better security and privac Certain networks have made changes to prevent them from being used by such multi-network IM client For example Trillian had to release several revisions and patches to allow its users to access the MSN AOL and Yahoo! networks after changes were made to these network The major IM providers usually cite the need for formal agreements and security concerns as reasons for making these change The use of proprietary protocols has meant that many instant messaging networks have been incompatible and users have been unable to reach users on other network This has cost the instant messaging format dearl Mobile instant messaging Mobile instant messaging MIM is the technology that allows instant messaging services to be accessed from a portable device ranging from standard mobile phones to smartphones e. devices using operating systems such as Android Blackberry OS iOS Symbian OS Windows Phone et a It is done two ways Embedded clients tailored IM client for every specific devic Clientless platform a browser-based application that does not need to download any software to the handset and which enables all users and all devices from any network to connect to their Internet IM service ideall In practice browser limits can pose problem In web browser In 2002 Icq introduced a web-based version of their IM client that works in a web browser and doesn t require download and instal Soon after Yahoo did the same thin Later some e-mail services integrated their web-based Instant Messengers into their web-based e-mail page Gmail introduced instant messaging ability in its webpages which can be used in a web browser with no need to download and install the IM client and indeed Google doesn t make one availabl Later Yahoo! Mail and Hotmail also implemented thi Several independent SaaS providers offers instant messaging of different IM service Generally such services are limited to text chat although Gmail has voice and video abilities and Yahoo! Doodle incorporates a multi-color drawing pa As of August 2010 Gmail allows calling regular phones from their web-based IM clien Interface chat is a Browser Chat Addon for the Dooble Web Browser to chat serverless and fully distribute Friend-to-friend networks Instant messaging may be done in a friend-to-friend network in which each node connects to the friends on the friends list This allows for communication with friends of friends and for the building of chatrooms for instant messages with all friends on that networ IM language See also SMS language Users sometimes make use of internet slang or text speak to abbreviate common words or expressions to quicken conversations or reduce keystroke The language has become widespread with well-known expressions such as lol translated over to face-to-face languag Emotions are often expressed in shorthand such as the abbreviation LOL BRB and TTYL respectively laugh ing out loud be right back and talk to you late Some however attempt to be more accurate with emotional expression over I Real time reactions such as chortle snort guffaw or eye-roll are becoming more popula Also there are certain standards that are being introduced into mainstream conversations including indicates the use of sarcasm in a statement and * which indicates a spelling mistake and/or grammatical error in the prior message followed by a correctio Business application Instant messaging has proven to be similar to personal computers email and the World Wide Web in that its adoption for use as a business communications medium was driven primarily by individual employees using consumer software at work rather than by formal mandate or provisioning by corporate information technology department Tens of millions of the consumer IM accounts in use are being used for business purposes by employees of companies and other organization In response to the demand for business-grade IM and the need to ensure security and legal compliance a new type of instant messaging called Enterprise Instant Messaging EIM was created when Lotus Software launched IBM Lotus Sametime in 199 Microsoft followed suit shortly thereafter with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging later created a new platform called Microsoft Office Live Communications Server and released Office Communications Server 2007 in October 200 Oracle Corporation has also jumped into the market recently with its Oracle Beehive unified collaboration softwar Both IBM Lotus and Microsoft have introduced federation between their EIM systems and some of the public IM networks so that employees may use one interface to both their internal EIM system and their contacts on AOL MSN and Yahoo! As of 2010 leading EIM platforms include IBM Lotus Sametime Microsoft Office Communications Server Jabber XCP and Cisco Unified Presence Industry-focused EIM platforms as Reuters Messaging and Bloomberg Messaging also provide enhanced IM abilities to financial services companie The adoption of IM across corporate networks outside of the control of IT organizations creates risks and liabilities for companies who do not effectively manage and support IM us Companies implement specialized IM archiving and security products and services to mitigate these risks and provide safe secure productive instant messaging abilities to their employee IM is increasingly becoming a feature of Enterprise Software rather than a stand-alone applicatio Review of products IM products can usually be categorised into two types Enterprise Instant Messaging EIM and Consumer Instant Messaging CIM Enterprise solutions use an internal IM server however this isn t always feasible particularly for smaller businesses with limited budget The second option using a CIM provides the advantage of being inexpensive to implement and has little need for investing in new hardware or server softwar For corporate use encryption and conversation archiving are usually regarded as important features due to security concern Sometimes the use of different operating systems in organizations requires use of software that supports more than one platfor For example many software companies use Windows XP in administration departments but have software developers who use Linux A company with Windows network could use a software application like ShixxNOTE which is a network-enabled sticky notes progra Every computer on the network listens for new messages which when found are presented to the user like colorful desktop sticky notes via which a reply can be sent instantl Risks and liabilities Although instant messaging delivers many benefits it also carries with it certain risks and liabilities particularly when used in workplace Among these risks and liabilities are Security risks e. IM used to infect computers with spyware viruses trojans worms Compliance risks Inappropriate use Trade secret leakage Security risks Crackers malicious hacker or black hat hacker have consistently used IM networks as vectors for delivering phishing attempts poison URLs and virus-laden file attachments from 2004 to the present with over 1100 discrete attacks listed by the IM Security Center in 2004200 Hackers use two methods of delivering malicious code through IM delivery of viruses trojan horses or spyware within an infected file and the use of socially engineered text with a web address that entices the recipient to click on a URL connecting him or her to a website that then downloads malicious cod Viruses computer worms and trojans usually propagate by sending themselves rapidly through the infected user s contact list An effective attack using a poisoned URL may reach tens of thousands of users in a short period when each user s contact list receives messages appearing to be from a trusted frien The recipients click on the web address and the entire cycle starts agai Infections may range from nuisance to criminal and are becoming more sophisticated each yea IM connections usually occur in plain text making them vulnerable to eavesdroppin Also IM client software often requires the user to expose open UDP ports to the world raising the threat posed by potential security vulnerabilitie Compliance risks In addition to the malicious code threat the use of instant messaging at work also creates a risk of non-compliance to laws and regulations governing use of electronic communications in businesse In the United States alone there are over 10,000 laws and regulations related to electronic messaging and records retentio The better-known of these include the SarbanesOxley Act HIPAA and SEC 17a- Clarification from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority FINRA was issued to member firms in the financial services industry in December 2007 noting that electronic communications email and electronic correspondence may be used interchangeably and can include such forms of electronic messaging as instant messaging and text messaging Changes to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure effective December 1 2006 created a new category for electronic records which may be requested during discovery in legal proceeding Most nations also regulate use of electronic messaging and electronic records retention in similar fashion as the United State The most common regulations related to IM at work involve the need to produce archived business communications to satisfy government or judicial requests under la Many instant messaging communications fall into the category of business communications that must be archived and retrievabl Inappropriate use Organizations of all types must protect themselves from the liability of their employees inappropriate use of I The informal immediate and ostensibly anonymous nature of instant messaging makes it a candidate for abuse in the workplac The topic of inappropriate IM use became front page news in October 2006 when U. Congressman Mark Foley resigned his seat after admitting sending offensive instant messages of a sexual nature to underage former House pages from his Congressional office P The Mark Foley Scandal led to media coverage and mainstream newspaper articles warning of the risks of inappropriate IM use in workplace In most nations corporations have a legal responsibility to ensure harassment-free work environment for employee The use of corporate-owned computers networks and software to harass an individual or spread inappropriate jokes or language creates a liability for not only the offender but also the employe A survey by IM archiving and security provider Akonix Systems In in March 2007 showed that 31% of respondents had been harassed over IM at wor Companies now include instant messaging as an integral component of their policies on appropriate use of the World Wide Web email and other corporate asset Security and archiving In the early 2000s a new class of IT security provider emerged to provide remedies for the risks and liabilities faced by corporations who chose to use IM for business communication The IM security providers created new products to be installed in corporate networks for the purpose of archiving content-scanning and security-scanning IM traffic moving in and out of the corporatio Similar to the e-mail filtering vendors the IM security providers focus on the risks and liabilities described abov With rapid adoption of IM in the workplace demand for IM security products began to grow in the mid-2000 By 2007 the preferred platform for the purchase of security software had become the computer appliance according to IDC who estimate that by 2008 80% of network security products will be delivered via an applianc User base Many of the numbers listed in this section are not directly comparable and some are speculativ While some numbers are given by the owners of a complete instant messaging system others are provided by commercial vendors of a part of a distributed system Some companies may be motivated to inflate their numbers to raise advertising earnings or attract partners clients or customer Importantly some numbers are reported as the number of active users with no shared standard of that activity others indicate total user accounts while others indicate only the users logged in during an instance of peak us Users Service Peak Active Total Date/source AIM 4 million 100 million Active April 2012 Total January 2006 Blauk 0.7 million* *Peak is per day eBuddy 35 million October 2006 including 4 million mobile users Gadu-Gadu 6 million May 2009 Most users in Poland IBM Lotus Sametime 40 million December 200 Total is licensed entitled users in enterprises [ citation needed ] ICQ 50 million CNET February 8 2010 iMessage 140 million 140 million 140 million Engadget June 11 2012 IMVU 1 million June 2007 Lync 3 million December 2011 Total voice lines Meebo 1 million October 2006 MXit 11 million January 29 2009 Total includes 9 million in South Africa Paltalk 3.3 million* August 2006 *Peak is unique visitors per month Skype 30 million 1090 million March 2011 Total as of April 13th 2012 can be checked when searching users in Skype 5.x Tencent QQ 160 million 440 million* 990 million Q s official website Most users in China *Active includes users with multiple accounts Windows Live Messenger formerly MSN Messenger 330 million June 2009 Wireclub 3 million November 2011 Xfire 16 million May 2010 Yahoo!
