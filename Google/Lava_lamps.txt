Patent 3,387,396 for Display Device was filed in 1965 and issued in 196 Craven-Walker s company was named Crestworth and was based in Poole Dorset in the United Kingdom Craven-Walker named the lamp Astro and had variations such as the Astro Mini and the Astro Coach lanter Craven-Walker presented it at a Brussels trade show in 1965 where the entrepreneur Adolph Wertheimer noticed i Wertheimer and his business partner William Rubinstein bought the U. rights to manufacture and sell it as the Lava Lite via Lava Corporation or Lava Manufacturing Corporatio Wertheimer sold his shares to Hy Spector who took the product into production manufacturing and marketing the Lava Lite in his Chicago factory at 1650 Irving Park Rd in the mid-1960 Rubinstein stayed on as a vice presiden The lamps were a success throughout the 1960s and early 1970 Lava Corporation s name changed to Lava-Simplex-Scribe International in the early 1970s and made instant-loading camera-film cartridges as well as postage-stamp vending machine In the late seventies Spector sold Lava Simplex International to Michael Eddie and Lawrence Haggerty of Haggerty Enterprise Haggerty Enterprises continues to sell the Lava Lamp in the U Lava lamp has been used as a generic term but Lavaworld has claimed violation of trademark In the 1990s Craven-Walker who had retained the rights for the rest of the world took on a business partner called Cressida Granger They changed the company name to Mathmos in 199 Mathmos continues to make Lava Lamps and related product Mathmos lava lamps are still made in the original factory in Poole Dorset U Hazards In 2004 Phillip Quinn a 24-year-old of Kent Washington was killed during an attempt to heat up a lava lamp on his kitchen stove while closely observing it from only a few feet awa The heat from the stove built up pressure in the lamp until it exploded spraying shards of glass with enough force to pierce his chest with one shard piercing his heart and causing fatal injurie The circumstances of his death were later reenacted in a 2006 episode of the popular science television series MythBusters The show found that even if shards of glass are not thrown with lethal velocity during such an attempt the resulting spray of hot liquid from the lamp could easily cause severe burns to anyone nearb The show also noted that the safety instructions clearly state that lava lamps should not be heated by any source other than the specifically rated bulbs and purpose-designed bases that are provide Homebrew lava lamp recipes can be found over internet however some of them rely on combinations of highly flammable components like alcoho Such lamps could represent a serious fire hazard in the case of rupture when heated over a light bul The carbon tetrachloride is poisonou It presents a danger to pets and small children who could accidentally ingest the lava lamp contents upon breaking/spilling the lam Oral doses as low as 400mg/kg have resulted in the death of cats while oral doses as low as 40mg/kg have reportedly caused death in human Inhalation of carbon tetrachloride fumes is also dangerou Wikimedia Commons has media related to Lava lamps See also Lavarand random number generator that used lava lamp Plasma globe Lava Notes U.
