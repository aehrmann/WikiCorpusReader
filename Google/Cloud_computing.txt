Cloud computing logical diagram Cloud computing is the use of computing resources hardware and software that are delivered as a service over a network typically the Internet The name comes from the use of a cloud -shaped symbol as an abstraction for the complex infrastructure it contains in system diagram Cloud computing entrusts remote services with a user s data software and computatio There are many types of public cloud computing Infrastructure as a service IaaS Platform as a service PaaS Software as a service SaaS Storage as a service STaaS Security as a service SECaaS Data as a service DaaS Test environment as a service TEaaS Desktop as a service DaaS API as a service APIaaS Backend as a service Baas The business model using software as a service users also rent application software and database The cloud providers manage the infrastructure and platforms on which the applications ru End users access cloud-based applications through a web browser or a light-weight desktop or mobile app while the business software and user s data are stored on servers at a remote locatio Proponents claim that cloud computing allows enterprises to get their applications up and running faster with improved manageability and less maintenance and enables IT to more rapidly adjust resources to meet fluctuating and unpredictable business deman Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economies of scale similar to a utility like the electricity grid over a networ At the foundation of cloud computing is the broader concept of converged

History This section requires expansion June 2012 The origin of the term cloud computing is obscure but it appears to derive from the practice of using drawings of stylized clouds to denote networks in diagrams of computing and communications system The word cloud is used as a metaphor for the Internet based on the standardized use of a cloud-like shape to denote a network on telephony schematics and later to depict the Internet in computer network diagrams as an abstraction of the underlying infrastructure it represent The cloud symbol was used to represent the Internet as early as 199 In the 1990s telecommunications companies who previously offered primarily dedicated point-to-point data circuits began offering virtual private network VPN services with comparable quality of service but at a much lower cos By switching traffic to balance utilization as they saw fit they were able to utilize their overall network bandwidth more effectivel The cloud symbol was used to denote the demarcation point between that which was the responsibility of the provider and that which was the responsibility of the user Cloud computing extends this boundary to cover servers as well as the network infrastructur The underlying concept of cloud computing dates back to the 1950s when large-scale mainframe became available in academia and corporations accessible via thin clients terminal computer Because it was costly to buy a mainframe it became important to find ways to get the greatest return on the investment in them allowing multiple users to share both the physical access to the computer from multiple terminals as well as to share the CPU time eliminating periods of inactivity which became known in the industry as time-sharing As computers became more prevalent scientists and technologists explored ways to make large-scale computing power available to more users through time sharing experimenting with algorithms to provide the optimal use of the infrastructure platform and applications with prioritized access to the CPU and efficiency for the end user John McCarthy opined in the 1960s that computation may someday be organized as a public utility Almost all the modern-day characteristics of cloud computing elastic provision provided as a utility online illusion of infinite supply the comparison to the electricity industry and the use of public private government and community forms were thoroughly explored in Douglas Parkhill s 1966 book The Challenge of the Computer Utility Other scholars have shown that cloud computing s roots go all the way back to the 1950s when scientist Herb Grosch the author of Grosch s law postulated that the entire world would operate on dumb terminals powered by about 15 large data center Due to the expense of these powerful computers many corporations and other entities could avail themselves of computing capability through time sharing and several organizations such as GE s GEISCO IBM subsidiary The Service Bureau Corporation SBC founded in 1957 Tymshare founded in 1966 National CSS founded in 1967 and bought by Dun Bradstreet in 1979 Dial Data bought by Tymshare in 1968 and Bolt Beranek and Newman BBN marketed time sharing as a commercial ventur The development of the Internet from being document centric via semantic data towards more and more services was described as Dynamic Web This contribution focused in particular in the need for better meta-data able to describe not only implementation details but also conceptual details of model-based application The ubiquitous availability of high-capacity networks low-cost computers and storage devices as well as the widespread adoption of hardware virtualization service-oriented architecture autonomic and utility computing have led to a tremendous growth in cloud computin After the dot-com bubble Amazon played a key role in the development of cloud computing by modernizing their data centers which like most computer networks were using as little as 10% of their capacity at any one time just to leave room for occasional spike Having found that the new cloud architecture resulted in significant internal efficiency improvements whereby small fast-moving two-pizza teams teams small enough to be fed with two pizzas could add new features faster and more easily Amazon initiated a new product development effort to provide cloud computing to external customers and launched Amazon Web Service AWS on a utility computing basis in 200 In early 2008 Eucalyptus became the first open-source AWS API-compatible platform for deploying private cloud In early 2008 OpenNebula enhanced in the RESERVOIR European Commission-funded project became the first open-source software for deploying private and hybrid clouds and for the federation of cloud In the same year efforts were focused on providing quality of service guarantees as required by real-time interactive applications to cloud-based infrastructures in the framework of the IRMOS European Commission-funded project resulting to a real-time cloud environment By mid-2008 Gartner saw an opportunity for cloud computing to shape the relationship among consumers of IT services those who use IT services and those who sell them and observed that organizations are switching from company-owned hardware and software assets to per-use service-based models so that the projected shift to computing. will result in dramatic growth in IT products in some areas and significant reductions in other area On March 1 2011 IBM announced the Smarter Computing framework to support Smarter Plane

gaming data will be stored in the provider s server so that gaming will be independent of client computers used to play the gam Characteristics Cloud computing exhibits the following key characteristics Agility improves with users ability to re-provision technological infrastructure resource Application programming interface API accessibility to software that enables machines to interact with cloud software in the same way the user interface facilitates interaction between humans and computer Cloud computing systems typically use REST -based API Cost is claimed to be reduced and in a public cloud delivery model capital expenditure is converted to operational expenditure This is purported to lower barriers to entry as infrastructure is typically provided by a third-party and does not need to be purchased for one-time or infrequent intensive computing task Pricing on a utility computing basis is fine-grained with usage-based options and fewer IT skills are required for implementation in-house The e-FISCAL project s state of the art repository contains several articles looking into cost aspects in more detail most of them concluding that costs savings depend on the type of activities supported and the type of infrastructure available in-hous Device and location independence enable users to access systems using a web browser regardless of their location or what device they are using e.g. PC mobile phone As infrastructure is off-site typically provided by a third-party and accessed via the Internet users can connect from anywher Virtualization technology allows servers and storage devices to be shared and utilization be increase Applications can be easily migrated from one physical server to anothe Multitenancy enables sharing of resources and costs across a large pool of users thus allowing for Centralization of infrastructure in locations with lower costs such as real estate electricity et Peak-load capacity increases users need not engineer for highest possible load-levels Utilisation and efficiency improvements for systems that are often only 1020% utilise Reliability is improved if multiple redundant sites are used which makes well-designed cloud computing suitable for business continuity and disaster recovery Scalability and elasticity via dynamic on-demand provisioning of resources on a fine-grained self-service basis near real-time without users having to engineer for peak load Performance is monitored and consistent and loosely coupled architectures are constructed using web services as the system interfac Security could improve due to centralization of data increased security-focused resources etc. but concerns can persist about loss of control over certain sensitive data and the lack of security for stored kernel Security is often as good as or better than other traditional systems in part because providers are able to devote resources to solving security issues that many customers cannot affor However the complexity of security is greatly increased when data is distributed over a wider area or greater number of devices and in multi-tenant systems that are being shared by unrelated user In addition user access to security audit logs may be difficult or impossibl Private cloud installations are in part motivated by users desire to retain control over the infrastructure and avoid losing control of information securit Maintenance of cloud computing applications is easier because they do not need to be installed on each user s computer and can be accessed from different place On-demand self-service See also Self-service provisioning for cloud computing services and Service catalogs for cloud computing services On-demand self-service allows users to obtain configure and deploy cloud services themselves using cloud service catalogues without requiring the assistance of I This feature is listed by the The National Institute of Standards and Technology NIST as a characteristic of cloud computin The self-service requirement of cloud computing prompts infrastructure vendors to create cloud computing templates which are obtained from cloud service catalogue Manufacturers of such templates or blueprints include Hewlett-Packard HP which names its templates as HP Cloud Maps RightScale and Red Hat which names its templates CloudForm The templates contain predefined configurations used to by consumers to set up cloud service The templates or blueprints provide the technical information necessary to build ready-to-use cloud Each template includes specific configuration details for different cloud infrastructures with information about servers for specific tasks such as hosting applications databases websites and so o The templates also include predefined Web service the operating system the database security configurations and load balancin Cloud consumers use cloud templates to move applications between clouds through a self-service porta The predefined blueprints define all that an application requires to run in different environment For example a template could define how the same application could be deployed in cloud platforms based on Amazon Web Service VMware or Red Ha The user organization benefits from cloud templates because the technical aspects of cloud configurations reside in the templates letting users to deploy cloud services with a push of a butto Cloud templates can also be used by developers to create a catalog of cloud service Service models Cloud computing providers offer their services according to three fundamental models Infrastructure as a service IaaS platform as a service PaaS and software as a service SaaS where IaaS is the most basic and each higher model abstracts from the details of the lower model Infrastructure as a service IaaS See also Category Cloud infrastructure In this most basic cloud service model cloud providers offer computers as physical or more often as virtual machines and other resource The virtual machines are run as guests by a hypervisor such as Xen or KVM Management of pools of hypervisors by the cloud operational support system leads to the ability to scale to support a large number of virtual machine Other resources in IaaS clouds include images in a virtual machine image library raw block and file-based storage firewalls load balancers IP addresses virtual local area networks VLANs and software bundle Amies Alex Sluiman Harm Tong IaaS cloud providers supply these resources on demand from their large pools installed in data centers For wide area connectivity the Internet can be used orin carrier clouds -- dedicated virtual private networks can be configured.

operating system images on the machines as well as their application softwar In this model it is the cloud user who is responsible for patching and maintaining the operating systems and application softwar Cloud providers typically bill IaaS services on a utility computing basis that is cost will reflect the amount of resources allocated and consume IaaS refers not to a machine that does all the work but simply to a facility given to businesses that offers users the leverage of extra storage space in servers and data center Examples of IaaS include Amazon CloudFormation and underlying services such as Amazon EC2 Rackspace Cloud Terremark Windows Azure Virtual Machines Google Compute Engine and Joyent Platform as a service PaaS Main article Platform as a service See also Category Cloud platforms In the PaaS model cloud providers deliver a computing platform typically including operating system programming language execution environment database and web serve Application developers can develop and run their software solutions on a cloud platform without the cost and complexity of buying and managing the underlying hardware and software layer With some PaaS offers the underlying computer and storage resources scale automatically to match application demand such that cloud user does not have to allocate resources manuall Examples of PaaS include Amazon Elastic Beanstalk Cloud Foundry Heroku Force.com EngineYard Mendix Google App Engine Windows Azure Compute and OrangeScape Software as a service SaaS Main article Software as a service In this model cloud providers install and operate application software in the cloud and cloud users access the software from cloud clients The cloud users do not manage the cloud infrastructure and platform on which the application is runnin This eliminates the need to install and run the application on the cloud user s own computers simplifying maintenance and suppor What makes a cloud application different from other applications is its scalabilit This can be achieved by cloning tasks onto multiple virtual machines at run-time to meet the changing work deman Load balancers distribute the work over the set of virtual machine This process is transparent to the cloud user who sees only a single access poin To accommodate a large number of cloud users cloud applications can be multitenant that is any machine serves more than one cloud user organizatio It is common to refer to special types of cloud based application software with a similar naming convention desktop as a service business process as a service test environment as a service communication as a service The pricing model for SaaS applications is typically a monthly or yearly flat fee per user so price is scalable and adjustable if users are added or removed at any poin Examples of SaaS include Google Apps Microsoft Office 365 and Onlive Cloud clients See also Category Cloud clients Users access cloud computing using networked client devices such as desktop computers laptops tablets and smartphones Some of these devices - cloud clients - rely on cloud computing for all or a majority of their applications so as to be essentially useless without i Examples are thin clients and the browser-based Chromebook Many cloud applications do not require specific software on the client and instead use a web browser to interact with the cloud applicatio With Ajax and HTML5 these Web user interfaces can achieve a similar or even better look and feel as native application Some cloud applications however support specific client software dedicated to these applications e.g. virtual desktop clients and most email clients Some legacy applications line of business applications that until now have been prevalent in thin client Windows computing are delivered via a screen-sharing technolog Deployment models Cloud computing types Public cloud Public cloud applications storage and other resources are made available to the general public by a service provide These services are free or offered on a pay-per-use mode Generally public cloud service providers like Amazon AWS Microsoft and Google own and operate the infrastructure and offer access only via Internet direct connectivity is not offered Community cloud Community cloud shares infrastructure between several organizations from a specific community with common concerns security compliance jurisdiction et whether managed internally or by a third-party and hosted internally or externall The costs are spread over fewer users than a public cloud but more than a private cloud so only some of the cost savings potential of cloud computing are realize Hybrid cloud Hybrid cloud is a composition of two or more clouds private community or public that remain unique entities but are bound together offering the benefits of multiple deployment model By utilizing hybrid cloud architecture companies and individuals are able to obtain degrees of fault tolerance combined with locally immediate usability without dependency on internet connectivit Hybrid cloud architecture requires both on-premises resources and off-site remote server-based cloud infrastructur Hybrid clouds lack the flexibility security and certainty of in-house application Hybrid cloud provides the flexibility of in house applications with the fault tolerance and scalability of cloud based service Private cloud Private cloud is cloud infrastructure operated solely for a single organization whether managed internally or by a third-party and hosted internally or externall Undertaking a private cloud project requires a significant level and degree of engagement to virtualize the business environment and it will require the organization to reevaluate decisions about existing resource When it is done right it can have a positive impact on a business but every one of the steps in the project raises security issues that must be addressed in order to avoid serious vulnerabilitie They have attracted criticism because users still have to buy build and manage them and thus do not benefit from less hands-on management essentially [lacking] the economic model that makes cloud computing such an intriguing concept Architecture Cloud computing sample architecture Cloud architecture the systems architecture of the software systems involved in the delivery of cloud computing typically involves multiple cloud components communicating with each other over a loose coupling mechanism such as a messaging queu Elastic provision implies intelligence in the use of tight or loose coupling

on which it is base Cloud engineering Cloud engineering is the application of engineering disciplines to cloud computin It brings a systematic approach to the high-level concerns of commercialisation standardisation and governance in conceiving developing operating and maintaining cloud computing system It is a multidisciplinary method encompassing contributions from diverse areas such as systems software web performance information security platform risk and quality engineerin Issues Privacy The cloud model has been criticised by privacy advocates for the greater ease in which the companies hosting the cloud services control thus can monitor at will lawfully or unlawfully the communication and data stored between the user and the host compan Instances such as the secret NSA program working with ATT and Verizon which recorded over 10 million phone calls between American citizens causes uncertainty among privacy advocates and the greater powers it gives to telecommunication companies to monitor user activit Using a cloud service provider CSP can complicate privacy of data because of the extent to which virtualization for cloud processing virtual machines and cloud storage are used to implement cloud servic The point is that CSP operations customer or tenant data may not remain on the same system or in the same data center or even within the same provider s clou This can lead to legal concerns over jurisdictio While there have been efforts such as US-EU Safe Harbor to harmonise the legal environment providers such as Amazon still cater to major markets typically the United States and the European Union by deploying local infrastructure and allowing customers to select availability zone Cloud computing poses privacy concerns because the service provider may access the data that is on the cloud at any point in tim They could accidentally or deliberately alter or even delete informatio Postage and delivery services company Pitney Bowes launched Volly a cloud-based digital mailbox service to leverage its communication management asset They also faced the technical challenge of providing strong data security and privac However they were able to address the same concern by applying customized application-level security including encryptio Compliance In order to obtain compliance with regulations including FISMA HIPAA and SOX in the United States the Data Protection Directive in the EU and the credit card industry s PCI DSS users may have to adopt community or hybrid deployment modes that are typically more expensive and may offer restricted benefit This is how Google is able to manage and meet additional government policy requirements beyond FISMA and Rackspace Cloud or QubeSpace are able to claim PCI complianc Many providers also obtain a SAS 70 Type II audit but this has been criticised on the grounds that the hand-picked set of goals and standards determined by the auditor and the auditee are often not disclosed and can vary widel Providers typically make this information available on request under non-disclosure agreement Customers in the EU contracting with cloud providers outside the EU/EEA have to adhere to the EU regulations on export of personal dat U. Federal Agencies have been directed by the Office of Management and Budget to use a process called FedRAMP Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program to assess and authorize cloud products and service Federal CIO Steven VanRoekel issued a memorandum to federal agency Chief Information Officers on December 8 2011 defining how federal agencies should use FedRAM FedRAMP consists of a subset of NIST Special Publication 800-53 security controls specifically selected to provide protection in cloud environment A subset has been defined for the FIPS 199 low categorization and the FIPS 199 moderate categorizatio The FedRAMP program has also established a Joint Accreditation Board JAB consisting of Chief Information Officers from DoD DHS and GS The JAB is responsible for establishing accreditation standards for 3rd party organizations who will perform the assessments of cloud solution The JAB will also review authorization packages and may grant provisional authorization to operate The federal agency consuming the service will still have the final responsibility for final authority to operat Legal This section requires expansion with examples and additional citation

model can differ widely from those of traditional architecture An alternative perspective on the topic of cloud security is that this is but another although quite broad case of applied security and that similar security principles that apply in shared multi-user mainframe security models apply with cloud securit The relative security of cloud computing services is a contentious issue that may be delaying its adoptio Physical control of the Private Cloud equipment is more secure than having the equipment off site and under someone elses contro Physical control and the ability to visually inspect the data links and access ports is required in order to ensure data links are not compromise Issues barring the adoption of cloud computing are due in large part to the private and public sectors unease surrounding the external management of security-based service It is the very nature of cloud computing-based services private or public that promote external management of provided service This delivers great incentive to cloud computing service providers to prioritize building and maintaining strong management of secure service Security issues have been categorised into sensitive data access data segregation privacy bug exploitation recovery accountability malicious insiders management console security account control and multi-tenancy issue Solutions to various cloud security issues vary from cryptography particularly public key infrastructure PKI to use of multiple cloud providers standardisation of APIs and improving virtual machine support and legal

vulnerabilities in the syste There are many underlying challenges and risks in cloud computing that increase the threat of data being compromise To help mitigate the threat cloud computing stakeholders should invest heavily in risk assessment to ensure that the system encrypts to protect data establishes trusted foundation to secure the platform and infrastructure and builds higher

be a form of green computing there is no published study to substantiate this assumptio citing the servers affects the environmental effects of cloud computin In areas where climate favors natural cooling and renewable electricity is readily available the environmental effects will be more moderat The same holds true for traditional data center Thus countries with favorable conditions such as Finland Sweden and Switzerland are trying to attract cloud computing data center Energy efficiency in cloud computing can result from energy-aware scheduling and server consolidatio However in the case of distributed clouds over data centers with different source of energies including renewable source of energies a small compromise on energy consumption reduction could result in high carbon footprint reductio Abuse As with privately purchased hardware customers can purchase the services of cloud computing for nefarious purpose This includes password cracking and launching attacks using
