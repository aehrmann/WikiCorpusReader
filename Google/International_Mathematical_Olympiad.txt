The logo of the International Mathematical Olympia The International Mathematical Olympiad IMO is an annual six-problem 42-point mathematical olympiad for pre- collegiate students and is the oldest of the International Science Olympiads The first IMO was held in Romania in 195 It has since been held annually except in 198 About 100 countries send teams of up to six students plus one team leader one deputy leader and observer Ever since its inception in 1959 the olympiad has developed a rich legacy and has established itself as the pinnacle of mathematical competition among high school student The content ranges from extremely difficult precalculus problems to problems on branches of mathematics not conventionally covered at school and often not at university level either such as projective and complex geometry functional equations and well-grounded number theory of which extensive knowledge of theorems is require Calculus though allowed in solutions is never required as there is a principle at play that anyone with a basic understanding of mathematics should understand the problems even if the solutions require a great deal more knowledg Supporters of this principle claim that this allows more universality and creates an incentive to find elegant deceptively simple-looking problems which nevertheless require a certain level of ingenuit The selection process differs by country but it often consists of a series of tests which admit fewer students at each progressing tes Awards are given to a top percentage of the individual contestant Teams are not officially recognizedall scores are given only to individual contestants but team scoring is unofficially compared more so than individual score Contestants must be under the age of 20 and must not be registered at any tertiary institution Subject to these conditions an individual may participate any number of times in the IM 1 History 2 Scoring and format 3 Selection process 4 Awards 5 Penalties 6 Current

The first IMO was held in Romania in 195 Since then it has been held every year except 198 That year it was cancelled due to internal strife in Mongolia It was initially founded for eastern European countries participating in the Warsaw Pact under the Soviet bloc of influence but eventually other countries participated as wel Because of this eastern origin the earlier IMOs were hosted only in eastern European countries and gradually spread to other nation Sources differ about the cities hosting some of the early IMO This may be partly because leaders are generally housed well away from the students and partly because after the competition the students did not always stay based in one city for the rest of the IM The exact dates cited may also differ because of leaders arriving before the students and at more recent IMOs the IMO Advisory Board arriving before the leader Several students such as Teodor von Burg Lisa Sauermann and Christian Reiher have performed exceptionally well on the IMO scoring multiple gold medal Others such as Grigory Margulis Jean-Christophe Yoccoz Stanislav Smirnov Terence Tao and Grigori Perelman have gone on to become notable mathematicians Several former participants have won awards such as the Fields medal In January 2011 Google gifted $1 million to the International Mathematical Olympiad organizatio The donation will help the organization cover the costs of the next five global events 20112015 Scoring and format The paper consists of six problems with each problem being worth seven points the total score thus being 42 point No calculators are allowe The examination is held over two consecutive days the contestants have four-and-a-half hours to solve three problems per da The problems chosen are from various areas of secondary school mathematics broadly classifiable as geometry number theory algebra and combinatorics They require no knowledge of higher mathematics such as calculus and analysis and solutions are often short and elementar However they are usually disguised so as to make the process of finding the solutions difficul Prominently featured are algebraic inequalities complex numbers and construction -oriented geometrical problems though in previous years the latter has not been as popular as befor Each participating country other than the host country may submit suggested problems to a Problem Selection Committee provided by the host country which reduces the submitted problems to a shortlis The team leaders arrive at the IMO a few days in advance of the contestants and form the IMO Jury which is responsible for all the formal decisions relating to the contest starting with selecting the six problems from the shortlis The Jury aims to select the problems so that the order in increasing difficulty is Q1 Q4 Q2 Q5 Q3 and Q As the leaders know the problems in advance of the contestants they are kept strictly separated and observe Each country s marks are agreed between that country s leader and deputy leader and coordinators provided by the host country the leader of the team whose country submitted the problem in the case of the marks of the host country subject to the decisions of the chief coordinator and ultimately a jury if any disputes cannot be resolve Selection process A stage in the process of solving a problem 1 from the AIME part of the USA s selection proces Main article International Mathematical Olympiad selection process The selection process for the IMO varies greatly by countr In some countries especially those in east Asia the selection process involves several difficult tests of a difficulty comparable to the IMO itsel The Chinese contestants go through a camp which lasts from March 16 to April In others such as the USA possible participants go through a series of easier standalone competitions that gradually increase in difficult In the case of the USA the tests include the American Mathematics Competitions the American Invitational Mathematics Examination and the United States of America Mathematical Olympiad each of which is a competition in its own righ For high scorers on the final competition for the team selection there also is a summer camp like that of Chin The former Soviet Union and other eastern European countries selection process consists of choosing a team several years beforehand and giving them special training specifically for the even However such methods have been discontinued in some countrie In Ukraine for instance selection tests consist of four olympiads comparable to the IMO by difficulty and schedul While identifying the winners only the results of the current selection olympiads are considere Awards Nikolay Nikolov won three gold medals 1992 1993 1995 with perfect score and special prize in 1995 The participants are ranked based on their individual score Medals are awarded to the highest ranked participants such that slightly less than half of them receive a meda Subsequently the cutoffs minimum scores required to receive a gold silver or bronze medal respectively are chosen such that the ratio of gold to silver to bronze medals awarded approximates 1 2 Participants who do not win a medal but who score seven points on at least one problem receive an honorable mentio Special prizes may be awarded for solutions of outstanding elegance or involving good generalisations of a proble This last happened in 2005 Iurie Boreico 1995 Nikolay Nikolov Bulgaria and 1988 Emanouil Atanassov Bulgaria but was more frequent up to the early 1980 The special prize in 2005 was awarded to Iurie Boreico a student from Moldova who came up with a brilliant solution to question 3 which was an inequality involving three variable Boreico was one of only three students to achieve a perfect score for that pape The rule that at most half the contestants win a medal is sometimes broken if adhering to it causes the number of medals to deviate too much from half the number of contestant This last happened in 2010 when the choice was to give either 226 43.71% or 266 51.45% of the 517 excluding the 6 from North Korea see below contestants a medal and 2012 when the choice was to give either 226 46.35% or 277 50.55% of the 548 contestants a meda Penalties North Korea was disqualified for cheating at the 32nd IMO in 1991 and the 51st IMO in 201 Current and future IMOs Members of the 2007

1-member team got a perfect score in IMO 198 The USA s success earned a mention in TIME Magazine Hungary won IMO 1975 in an unorthodox way when none of the eight team members received a gold medal

gold medals respectivel He won a gold medal when he just turned thirteen in IMO 1988 becoming the youngest person to receive a gold meda Tao also holds the distinction of being the youngest medalist

at the age of 14 in 198 Note that both Elkies and Tao could have participated in the IMO multiple times following their success but entered university and therefore became ineligibl Media coverage A
