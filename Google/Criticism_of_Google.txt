message content by Google s Gmail service goes beyond proper us Google In claims that mail sent to or from Gmail is never read by a human being other than the account holder and content that is read

search string entered onto Google s search engine over a two-month period absent any information identifying the person who entered such query Google fought the subpoena due to concerns about users privac In March 2006 the court ruled partially in Google s favor recognizing the privacy implications of turning over search terms and refusing to grant acces In April 2008 a Pittsburgh couple Aaron

its privac They lost their case in a Pennsylvania cour While it is easy to imagine that many whose property appears on Google s virtual maps resent the privacy implications it is hard to believe that

Not very likel Mozilla developer Asa Dotzler noted It seems pretty obvious to me that the Chrome team is bowing to pressure from Google s advertising business and that s a real sham I had hoped they d demonstrate a bit more independence than tha Google argued that the technology is useless at the present time as advertisers are not required to obey the user s tracking preference and as it remains unclear as to what constitutes tracking as opposed to storing statistical data or user preferences As an alternative Google offers an extension called Keep My Opt-Outs which permanently bars ad companies from installing cookies on the user s compute The reaction to this extension was mixe Paul Thurrott of Windows IT Pro called the extension much much closer to what I ve been asking fori. something that just works and doesn t require the user to figure anything outthan the IE or Firefox solutions while lamenting the fact that the extension is not included as part of the browser itsel In February 2012 Google announced that Chrome will incorporate a Do Not Track feature by the end of 201 Censorship Google has been criticized for various instances of censoring its search results many times in compliance with the laws of various countries most notably when it operated in China from Jan 2006 to March 201 Web search In the United States Google commonly censors search results to comply with Digital Millennium Copyright Act -related legal complaints such as in 2002 when Google censored websites that provided information critical of Scientology Furthermore in February 2003 Google stopped showing the advertisements of Oceana a non-profit organization protesting a major cruise ship operation [ disambiguation needed ] s sewage treatment practice Google cited its editorial policy at the time stating Google does not accept advertising if the ad or site advocates against other individuals groups or organization The policy was later change In the United Kingdom it was reported that Google had delisted Inquisition 21st century a website which claims to challenge moral authoritarian and sexually absolutist ideas in the United Kingdo Google later released a press

the inclusion of firearms and firearm-related products such as ammunition and accessory kit China See also Google China Google has been criticized for its censorship of certain sites in specific countries and region Until March 2010 Google adhered to the Internet censorship policies of China enforced by filters colloquially known as The Great Firewall of China Google.cn search results were filtered to remove some results concerning the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 sites supporting the independence movements of Tibet and Taiwan the Falun Gong movement and other information perceived to be harmful to the People s Republic of China PRC Google claimed that some censorship is necessary in order to keep the Chinese government from blocking Google entirely as occurred in 200 The company claims it did not plan to give the government information about users who search for blocked content and will inform users that content has been restricted if they attempt to search for i As of 2009 Google was the only major China-based search engine to explicitly inform the user when search results are blocked or hidde Some Chinese Internet users were critical of Google for assisting the Chinese government in repressing its own citizens particularly those dissenting against the government and advocating for human right Furthermore Google had been denounced and called hypocritical by Free Media Movement for agreeing to China s demands while simultaneously fighting the United States government s requests for similar informatio Google China had also been condemned by Reporters Without Borders Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International In 2009 China Central Television Xinhua News Agency People s Daily reported Google s dissemination of obscene information People s Daily claimed that Google s don t be evil motto becomes a fig leaf The Chinese government imposed administrative penalties to Google China and demanded for a reinforcement of the censorshi In 2010 according

operate an unfiltered search engine within the law if at al On March 22 2010 after talks with Chinese authorities failed to reach an agreement the company redirected its censor-complying Google China service to its Google Hong Kong service which is outside the jurisdiction of Chinese censorship law From the business perspective many recognize that the move was likely to affect Google s profits Google is going to pay a heavy price for its move which is why it deserves praise for refusing to censor its service in Chin However at least as of March 23 2010 The Great Firewall continues to censor search results from the Hong Kong portal www.google.com.hk as it does with the US portal www.google.com for controversial terms such as Falun gong and the June 4 incident Tiananmen Square incident

within 3 month It is not certain if the account revocations actually were on the grounds of anti-religious content however the cases have raised questions about Google s terms in regards to AdSense/AdWord The AdSense policy defines that Sites displaying Google ads may not include [...] advocacy against any individual group or organization which allows Google to revoke the above mentioned AdSense account In May 2011 Google cancelled the AdWord advertisement purchased by a Dublin sex worker rights group named Turn Off the Blue Light TOBL claiming that it represented an egregious violation of company ad policy by selling adult sexual services However TOBL is a nonprofit campaign for sex worker rights and is not advertising or selling adult sexual service In July after TOBL
