the Google Chrome OS operating system Chromebooks are known for their comparatively low cost and fast startup time The devices are designed to be used while connected to the Internet and rely almost entirely on Web applications rather than applications that reside on the machine itsel The first Chromebooks for sale by Acer In and Samsung were announced at the Google I/O conference in May 2011 and

from the company s retail partner By 2012 schools had become the largest category of custome With the third generation Chromebook Google broadened its marketing strategy to include first-time computer users and households seeking an additional compute Critical reaction to the devices has generally been skeptical with some reviewers unfavorably comparing the value proposition of Chromebooks with that of more fully featured laptops running the Microsoft Windows operating syste That complaint dissipated somewhat in reviews of the third generation machine which was priced significantly lowe In

multiple browser windows as well as a Web search button which replaces the caps lock ke An analysis of the Samsung Series 5 components by iFixit in June 2011 estimated that the unit cost about US$ 322 in materials and US$12 in labor cost With a retail price of US$499.99 and shipping marketing research and development and retail margins to account for this indicates that the profit margins on the Chromebooks are quite thin requiring a large production run to make a profi Models Google developed the first Chromebook the Cr-48 as a prototype machin The first commercial Chromebooks functionally

by Rajen Sheth best known as the father of Google Apps His strategy for marketing Chromebooks has centered on the total cost of ownership which he said can be dramatically reduced by lower maintenance management and security costs even if hardware costs remain unchange Chromebooks began selling through online channels including Amazon and Best Buy in the U.S. and in some European countries starting June 15 201 The first machines sold for between $349 and $499 depending on model and whether 3G was include Google also offered a monthly payment scheme for business and education customers at $28 and $20 per user per month respectively for a three-year contract including replacements and upgrade Verizon offered 100 megabytes of wireless data per month with an additional gigabyte at $20 per mont Google s early marketing efforts relied primarily on hands-on experience giving away Samsung machines to 10 Cr-48 pilot program participants along with the title Chromebook Guru and loaning Chromebooks to passengers on some Virgin America flight At the end of September 2011 Google launched the Chromezone a store within a store inside the Currys and PC World superstore in Londo The store had a Google-style look and feel with splashes of color all around the retail store fron Google said it was planning to open more Chromezones in the UK over the next few month In addition to these marketing strategies Google Chrome has created several Chromebook minis that demonstrate the ease of use and simplicity of the devices in a comical manne For example when the question How do you back up a Chromebook is asked it is implied to refer to data backup but instead shows two hands pushing a Chromebook back to the end of a tabl This is followed by the statement You don t have to back up a

Samsung Series 5 was reduced to $449 and the Acer AC700 was reduced to $29 By January 2012 commercial sales for Chromebooks were flat with the exception of the education marke Google had placed nearly 27,000 Chromebooks in schools across 41 states including one-on-one programs which allocate a computer for every student in South Carolina Illinois and Iow As of August 2012 over 500 school districts in the United States and Europe were using the device as well as universities corporations and government facilitie Reception Chromebooks Google s Sundar Pichai speaking about the Chromebook at its launch at Google I/O May 201 Some analysts viewed Google s web-centric operating system packaged with hardware as a direct attack on the market dominance of Microsoft Some observers argued that the success of the platform depends on the quality of available Web applications access to Windows applications on virtual desktops which is available from third party products and the ability of some applications to function offline Reviewing the Samsung Series 5 specifications Scott Stein of CNET was unimpressed with the Atom-based 12-incher with only 16GB of onboard storag Chrome OS might be lighter than Windows XP but we d still prefer more media storage spac At this price you could also get a 11.6-inch 290mm Wi-Fi AMD E-350-powered ultraportable running Windows 7 On the other hand MG Siegler of TechCrunch wrote a largely favorable review praising the improvements in speed and trackpad sensitivity over the CR-48 prototype as well as the long battery life and the fact that all models are priced below the iPad In June 2011 iFixit dismantled a Samsung Series 5 and concluded that it was essentially an improved Cr-4 They rated it as 6/10 for repairability predominantly because the case has to be opened to change the battery and because the RAM chip is soldered to the motherboar iFixit noted that the mostly-plastic construction felt a little cheap On the plus side they stated that the screen was easy to remove and most of the components including the solid state drive would be easy to replac iFixit s Kyle Wiens concluded Our analysis revealed that the Series 5 is a well-polished version of the rather imperfect Cr-48 prototype Chromeboo The Series 5 fixes the major shortfalls of the Cr-48 and adds the polish necessary to strike lust into the heart of a broad consumer base sleek looks 8+ hours of battery life and optimized performanc In an article published on ZDNet in June 2011 entitled Five Chromebook concerns for businesses Steven Vaughan-Nichols faulted the devices for lack of virtual private network capability not supporting some Wi-Fi security methods in particular Wi-Fi Protected Access II WPA2 Enterprise with Extensible Authentication Protocol-Transport Layer Security EAP-TLS or Ciscos Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol LEAP He also noted that its file manager does not work the need to use the undocumented crosh shell to accomplish basic tasks such as setting up a secure shell SSH network connection as well as serious deficiencies in documentatio In one of the first customer reviews the City of Orlando reported on their initial testing of 600 Chromebooks as part of a broader study related to accessing virtual desktop Early indications show potential value in reducing IT support cost End users have indicated that the Chromebook is easy to travel with and starts up quickl One stated that If I just need to stay connected for emergencies I take my Chrome but when traveling for business she would still take her lapto Orlando does plan to continue to use the Chromebook Shortly after the Samsung Series 5 Chromebook was released to the public in July 2011 the review site Chromebook Ratings praised the Series 5 and its 8-second boot-up time claiming that You can literally go from a cold machine to searching the internet in about 10 second Its one thing to see it described but its another to experience it first-han They also lauded the Series 5 for its exceptionally long battery life that exceeded the battery life of the Acer AC700 Chromeboo Reviewing the Samsung Series 5 Chromebook in July 2011 Benjamin Humphrey of OMG! Ubuntu! concluded Overall the Samsung Series 5 is a lovely piece of hardware and a perfect start to the Chromebook lineup...However the Series 5 as an overall product is let down by comparatively feature-poor softwar While you shouldnt expect a Chromebook to be a full replacement for a complete operating system it should be able to handle basic things such as copy and paste in the File Manager and playback of common local format Thankfully Chrome OS has a very quick release cycle of 6 weeks and many of my gripes have been addressed and are targeted to the next couple of updates so it can only get better...unless youre a keen early adopter Id suggest holding out until later in the year before purchasing a Chromebook to let the software mature a bit mor If youre simply after a tablet with a keyboard however the Series 5 might just be the perfect purchas Second generation In May 2012 Samsung introduced a second generation device the Chromebook Series 5 550 priced at US$449 for the Wi-Fi model and US$549 for 3 Reviews generally questioned the value propositio Dana Wollman of Engadget wrote that the Chromebook s keyboard put thousand-dollar Ultrabooks to shame and like the previous model the display quality is better than on many laptops selling for twice the pric But she wrote that the price seems like a lofty figure given how relatively little devices like this can actually d What s more that price seems to exist in a vacuum -- a place where tablet apps aren t growing more sophisticated where Transformer-like Win8 tablets aren t on the way and where there aren t some solid budget Windows machines to choose from Joey Sneddon of OMG! Chrome! in May 2012 also found fault with Samsung s pricing saying expecting people to fork out over $500 for a Chromebook is unrealisti People coming to ChromeOS will be prepared to make sacrifices but more money for less speed is unlikely to be one of the I cant help but feel that Samsung have priced the Chromebook to fai Joe Wilcox of BetaNews wrote that price to performance and how it compares to other choices is where Chromebook crumbles for many potential buyer He noted that the new models sell for more than their predecessors and while the price-performance ratio is quite favorable compared to the MacBook Air by the specs there are plenty of lower-cost option Third generation In October 2012 the Series 3 Chromebook was introduced at a San Francisco even The device is priced at $249 and is thinner and lighter than the Chromebook 55 Google has marketed the Series 3 as the computer for everyone due to its simple operating system Chrome OS and affordable pric Target markets include students and first-time computer users as well as households looking for an extra compute Joey Sneddon of OMG Chrome noted on 18 October 2012 We werent alone in criticising the prices of the Samsung Series 550 Chromebook released earlier this yea They were priced above and beyond the tipping point of casual consumers and sat firmly in the enthusiast lan As a result sales have been less than spectacular making it the 2nd generation of Chrome devices to fall short of taking off as Google hop Acers 2nd Gen Chromebook has also gone quietly MI But not ready to give up yet Google and Samsung are back with a newer cheaper ARM-powered Chromeboo CNET S review was more favorable saying the machine largely delivered as a computer for students and as an additional computer for a household--especially for users who are already using Google Web applications like Google Docs Google Drive and Gmai It s got workable if not standout hardware its battery life is good it switches on quickly and the $249 price tag means it s not as much of a commitment as the $550 Samsung Series 5 550 that arrived in Ma The review subtracted points for performanc It s fine for many tasks but power users accustomed to having more than a couple dozen browser tabs open should steer clea Chromeboxes In reviewing the first Samsung Chromebox desktop PC released in May 2012 Joey Sneddon of OMG! Chrome! described it as a tough sell He said Given Google Samsung and Acer have had a tough time trying to shift both the concept of ChromeOS and portable devices running it the success of ChromeOS on a traditional PC looks far from certai And if the steep pricing by TigerDirect holds true then Samsung may find themselves with an uphill struggle on their hands in gaining the device traction with consumer Trademark dispute In June 2010 ISYS Technologies based in Salt Lake City sued Google in a Utah district court claiming rights to the name Chromium and by default Chromebook and Chromebo The suit sought to stop Google and its hardware and marketing partners from selling Chromebook The suit was later dismissed and as part of an undisclosed settlement ISYS abandoned its trademark effort See also Google Nexus References a b Upson Linus Pichai Sundar May 11 2011 A New Kind Of Computer Chromebook The Official Google Blog Retrieved May 12 2011 Phipps Simon 26 October 2012 Why I left my MacBook for a Chromebook InfoWorld Retrieved 28 October 2012 Bailey Dan May 2011 Chrome OS File Manager Gets Secret Shortcuts Conceivably Tech Retrieved 14 May 2011 Smith Willia 8 Things You Need to Know About Chrome OS MaximumPC Retrieved 14 May 2011 a b c Sherr Ian May 11 2011 Google to launch Chrome Laptops in June Wall Street Journal Retrieved 11 May 2011 What is the Chrome Web Store?
