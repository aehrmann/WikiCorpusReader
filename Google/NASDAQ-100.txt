The NASDAQ-100 is a stock market index of 100 of the largest non-financial companies listed on the NASDAQ It is a modified capitalization-weighted index The companies weights in the index are based on their market capitalizations with certain rules capping the influence of the largest component It does not contain financial companies and includes companies incorporated outside the United States Both of those factors differentiate it from the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the exclusion of financial companies distinguishes it from the SP 500 Index 1 History 2 Investing 3 Standards 4 Yearly

New York Stock Exchange It did so by creating two separate indice This particular index which consists of Industrial Technology Retail Telecommunication Biotechnology Health Care Transportation Media and Service companies and the NASDAQ Financial-100 which consists of banking companies insurance firms brokerage houses and mortgage companies By creating these two indices the NASDAQ hoped that mutual funds options and futures would correlate and trade in conjunction with the The base price of the index was initially set at 250 but when it closed near 800 on December 31 1993 the base was reset at 125 the following trading day leaving the halved NASDAQ-100 price below that of the more commonly known NASDAQ Composite The first annual adjustments were made in 1993 in advance of options on the index that would trade at the Chicago Board Options Exchange in 199 Foreign companies were first admitted to the index in January 1998 but had higher standards to meet before they could be adde Those standards were relaxed in 2002 while standards for domestic firms were raised ensuring that all companies met the same standard The all-time highs for the index set at the height of the Dot-Com Bubble in 2000 stand above the 4,700 level while its recent bear market lows in 2002 revolving around the Early 2000s Recession the September 11 2001 Attacks and the subsequent Afghan War occurred below the 900 point leve After a gradual 5-year recovery to an intraday high of 2,239.51 on October 31 2007 the highest reached since February 16 2001 the index corrected below the 2,000 level in early 2008 amid the Late-2000s Recession the United States Housing Bubble and the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 Panic focusing on the failure of the investment banking industry culminated in a loss of more than 10% on September 29 2008 subsequently plunging the index firmly into bear market territor The NASDAQ-100 with much of the broader market experienced a Limit Down open on October 24 and reached a 6-year intraday low of 1,018 on November 20 200 By December 2010 the index more than doubled from there to the 2,160 level amid quantitative easing QE from the Federal Reserve and optimism that the financial crisis was endin Following more volatility related to the U. federal debt debate in August 2011 the index broke above 2,500 in early February 2012 to reach an intraday peak of 2,800 in late March surpassed following the announcement of QE3 on September 13 201 On September 19 the index reached 2,871.10 and closed at 2,864.03 its highest levels since December 11 2000 as large-cap tech stocks AAPL and GOOG made all-time closing highs above $700 and $725 respectivel Investing The NASDAQ-100 is often abbreviated as NDX in the derivatives markets Its corresponding futures contracts are traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange The regular futures are denoted by the Reuters Instrument Code ND and the smaller E-mini version uses the code N Both are among the most heavily traded futures at the exchang The NASDAQ-100 Trust Series 1 exchange-traded fund sponsored and overseen since March 21 2007 by Invesco through PowerShares trades under the ticker NASDAQ QQQ or cubes On December 1 2004 it was moved from the American Stock Exchange where it had the symbol QQQ to the NASDAQ and given the new four letter code QQQQ sometimes called the quad Qs by trader On March 23 2011 Nasdaq changed its symbol back to QQ In 2000 it was the most actively traded security in the United States and hit an all-time split adjusted intra-day trading high of $120.50 on March 24 of that year but has since dropped to being within the top five after other stocks and ETFs such as the Standard Poor s Depositary Receipts On July 17 2007 the ETF closed above $50 for the first time since early 200 After reaching a peak of $55.07 on October 31 2007 the Qs succumbed to a wider financial crisis along with a decline in technology spending and plunged towards a November 21 2008 intra-day low of $25.0 Since then it has gradually advanced to surpass its 2007 peak making new 11-3/4 year highs in September 2012 above $70 per shar ProShares issued by ProFunds offer other related NASDAQ-100

the years put in place a series of stringent standards that companies must meet before being included in the inde Those standards include the following Being listed exclusively on NASDAQ in either the Global Select or Global Market tier Being publically offered on an established American market for three month Having average daily volume of 200,000 share Being current in regards to quarterly and annual report Not being in bankruptcy proceeding Additionally companies with multiple classes of stock are only allowed to have one class included in the index usually the largest class in terms of market capitalization Yearly rebalancing and re-ranking While the composition of the NASDAQ-100 changes in the case of delisting such as transferring to another exchange merging with another company or declaring bankruptcy and in a few cases being delisted by NASDAQ for failing to meet listing requirements the index is only rebalanced once a year in December when NASDAQ reviews its components compares them with those not in the index re-ranks all eligible companies and makes the appropriate adjustment There are two tools the NASDAQ uses to determine the market values of companies for the annual review Share Prices as of the last trading day in Octobe Publicly announced share totals as of the last trading day of Novembe Those components that are in the top 100 of all eligible companies at the annual review are retained in the inde Those ranked 101 to 125 are retained only if they were in the top 100 of the previous year s annual revie If they fail to move into the top 100 in the following year s review they are droppe Those not ranked in the top 125 are dropped regardless of the previous year s ran A company will also be dropped if at the end of two consecutive months the component fails to have an index weighting of at least one-tenth of a percen This can occur at any tim The companies that are dropped are replaced by those who have the largest market value and are not in the index alread Anticipation of these changes can lead to changes in the stock prices of the affected companie All changes regardless of when they occur are publicly announced via press releases at least five business days before the change is scheduled to take plac The 2011 results of the re-ranking and rebalancing will be announced on December 9 with the changes effective the morning of December 19 coinciding with the expiration of options on December 1 Differences from NASDAQ Composite index The NASDAQ-100 is frequently confused with the Nasdaq Composite Index the latter

The NASDAQ-100 is a modified capitalization-weighted index This particular methodology was created in 1998 in advance of the creation the NASDAQ-100 Index Trust which holds portions of all NASDAQ-100 firm The new methodology allowed NASDAQ to reduce the influence of the largest companies and to allow for more diversificatio The only time the index is to be rebalanced again is if One company is worth 24% of the inde Those companies with a weighting of at least 4.5% constitute 48% of the inde Differences from other indices In addition to its lack of financial companies the Nasdaq-100 includes 13 companies incorporated outside the United State Although the SP 500 Index includes non-U. companies the Dow Jones Industrial Average has never included foreign companie As of July 2012 the
