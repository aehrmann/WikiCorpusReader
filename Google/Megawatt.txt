Important powers that are measured in nanowatts are also typically used in reference to radio and radar receiver Microwatt The microwatt is equal to one millionth 10 6 of a wat Important powers that are measured in microwatts are typically stated in medical instrumentation systems such as the EEG and the EKG in a wide variety of scientific and engineering instruments and also in reference to radio and radar receiver Compact solar cells for devices such as calculators and watches are typically measured in microwatt Milliwatt The milliwatt is equal to one thousandth 10 3 of a wat A typical laser pointer outputs about five milliwatts of light power whereas a typical hearing aid for people consumes less than one milliwat Kilowatt The kilowatt is equal to one thousand 10 3 watts or one sthene - metre per second This unit is typically used to express the output power of engines and the power consumption of electric motors tools machines and heater It is also a common unit used to express the electromagnetic power output of broadcast radio and television transmitters One kilowatt of power is approximately equal to 1.34 horsepower A small electric heater with one heating element can use 1.0 kilowatt which is equivalent to the power consumption of a household in the United States averaged over the entire year 8900 kW h divided by 36524 hours UK household consume about half this amount Also kilowatts of light power can be measured in the output pulses of some lasers A surface area of one square meter on Earth receives typically one kilowatt of power of sunlight from the sun on a clear day at mid day Megawatt The megawatt is equal to one million 10 6 watt Many events or machines produce or sustain the conversion of energy on this scale including lightning strikes large electric motors large warships such as aircraft carriers cruisers and submarines large server farms or data centers and some scientific research equipment such as supercolliders and also in the output pulses of very large laser A large residential or commercial building may consume several megawatts in electric power and hea The productive capacity of electrical generators operated by a utility company is often measured in megawatt A typical wind turbine or wind energy converter has a power capacity of 1 to 3 M On railways modern high-powered electric locomotives typically have a peak power output of 5 or 6MW although some produce much mor The Eurostar for example consumes more than 12MW while heavy diesel-electric locomotives typically produce/consume 3 to 5M U. nuclear power plants have net summer capacities between about 500 and 1300M The earliest citing of the megawatt in the Oxford English Dictionary OED is a reference in the 1900 Webster s International Dictionary of English Languag The OED also states that megawatt appeared in a 28 November 1947 article in the journal Science 506 2 Gigawatt The gigawatt is equal to one billion 10 9 watts or 1 gigawatt = 1000 megawatt This unit is sometimes used for large power plants or power grid For example by the end of 2010 power shortages in China s Shanxi province were expected to increase to 56 GW and the installed capacity of wind power in Germany was 25.8 G The largest unit out of four of the Belgian Nuclear Plant Doel has a peak output of 1.04 G Terawatt The terawatt is equal to one trillion 10 12 watt The total power used by humans worldwide about 16TW in 2006 is commonly measured in this uni The most powerful lasers from the mid-1960s to the mid-1990s produced power in terawatts but only for nanosecond time frame The average strike of lightning peaks at 1 terawatt but these strokes only last for 30 microseconds Petawatt The petawatt is equal to one quadrillion 10 15 watts and can be produced by the current generation of lasers for time-scales on the order of picoseconds 10 12 s One such laser is the Lawrence Livermore s Nova laser which achieved a power output of 1.25PW 1.25x10 15 W by a process called chirped pulse amplification The duration of the pulse was about 0.5 ps 5x10 -13 s giving a total energy of 600J or enough energy to power a 100W light bulb for six second Based on the average total solar irradiance of 1.366kW/m 2 the total power of sunlight striking Earth s atmosphere is estimated at 174PW c Solar Constant Electrical and thermal watts In the electric power industry megawatt electrical abbreviation MW e or MWe is a term that refers to electric power while megawatt thermal or thermal megawatt abbreviations MW t MW th MWt or MWth refers to thermal power produce Other SI prefixes are sometimes used for example gigawatt electrical GW e [ notes 2 ] For example the Embalse nuclear power plant in Argentina uses a fission reactor to generate 2109 MW t of heat which creates steam to drive a turbine which generates 648 MW e of electricity a numerical energy conversion efficiency of 648/2109 = 0.307 or 30.7% The difference is due to the inefficiency of steam-turbine generators and the limitations of the theoretical Carnot Cycle Confusion of watts watt-hours and watts per hour The terms power and energy are frequently confuse Power is the rate at which energy is generated or consume For example when a light bulb with a power rating of 100 W is turned on for one hour the energy used is 100 watt-hours Wh 0.1kilowatt-hour or 360 kJ This same amount of energy would light a 40-watt bulb for 2.5hours or a 50-watt bulb for 2hour A power station would be rated in multiples of watts but its annual energy sales would be in multiples of watt-hour A kilowatt-hour is the amount of energy equivalent to a steady power of 1 kilowatt running for 1 hour or 3.6 MJ 1000watts x 3600seconds i.e. 60seconds/minute x 60minutes/hour = 3600000Joules = 3.6MJ Terms such as watts per hour are often misuse Watts per hour properly refers to the change of power per hou Watts per hour W/h might be useful to characterize the ramp-up behavior of power plants For example a power plant that reaches a power output of 1MW from 0MW in 15 minutes has a ramp-up rate of 4MW Hydroelectric power plants have a very high ramp-up rate which makes them particularly useful in peak load and emergency situation Major energy production or consumption is often expressed as terawatt-hours for a given period that is often a calendar year or financial yea One terawatt-hour is equal to a sustained power of approximately 114 megawatts for a period of one yea The watt second is a unit of energy equal to the joule One kilowatt-hour is 3,600,000 watt-second The watt-second is used for example to rate the energy storage of flash lamps used in photography although the term joule is normally used rather than watt-secon See also Energy portal Conversion of units Declared net

stairs is given by mg Setting m=100 g=9.8 and h=3 gives 2940 Dividing this by the time taken 5s gives a power of 588 Megawatt electrical and megawatt thermal are not SI units Thompson and Taylor 2008
