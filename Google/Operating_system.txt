operating system that aims at executing real-time application Real-time operating systems often use specialized scheduling algorithms so that they can achieve a deterministic nature of behavio The main objective of real-time operating systems is their quick and predictable response to event They have an event-driven or time-sharing design and often aspects of bot An event-driven system switches between tasks based on their priorities or external events while time-sharing operating systems switch tasks based on clock interrupt Multi-user A multi-user operating system allows multiple users to access a computer system at the same tim Time-sharing systems and Internet servers can be classified as multi-user systems as they enable multiple-user access to a computer through the sharing of tim Single-user operating systems have only one user but may allow multiple programs to run at the same tim Multi-tasking v single-tasking A multi-tasking operating system allows more than one program to be running at a time from the point of view of human time scale A single-tasking system has only one running progra Multi-tasking can be of two types pre-emptive or co-operativ In pre-emptive multitasking the operating system slices the CPU time and dedicates one slot to each of the program Unix-like operating systems such as Solaris and Linux support pre-emptive multitasking as does

are designed to be used in embedded computer system They are designed to operate on small machines like PDAs with less autonom They are able to operate with a limited number of resource They are very compact and extremely efficient by desig Windows CE and Minix 3 are some examples of embedded operating system History Main article History of operating systems See also Resident monitor Early computers were built to perform a series of single tasks like a calculato Operating systems did not exist in their modern and more complex forms until the early 1960 Basic operating system features were developed in the 1950s such as resident monitor functions that could automatically run different programs in succession to speed up processin Hardware features were added that enabled use of runtime libraries interrupts and parallel processing When personal computers became popular in the 1980s operating system were made for them similar in concept to those used on larger computer In the 1940s the earliest electronic digital systems had no operating system Electronic systems of this time were programmed on rows of mechanical switches or by jumper wires on plug board These were special-purpose systems that for example generated ballistics tables for the military or controlled the printing of payroll checks from data on punched paper card After programmable general purpose computers were invented machine languages consisting of strings of the binary digits 0 and 1 on punched paper tape were introduced that sped up the programming process Stern 1981 OS/360 was used on most IBM mainframe computers beginning in 1966 including the computers that helped NASA put a man on the moo In the early 1950s a computer could execute only one program at a tim Each user had sole use of the computer for a limited period of time and would arrive at a scheduled time with program and data on punched paper cards and/or punched tap The program would be loaded into the machine and the machine would be set to work until the program completed or crashe Programs could generally be debugged via a front panel using toggle switches and panel light It is said that Alan Turing was a master of this on the early Manchester Mark 1 machine and he was already deriving the primitive conception of an operating system from the principles of the Universal Turing machine Later machines came with libraries of programs which would be linked to a user s program to assist in operations such as input and output and generating computer code from human-readable symbolic code This was the genesis of the modern-day computer syste However machines still ran a single job at a tim At Cambridge University in England the job queue was at one time a washing line from which tapes were hung with different colored clothes-pegs to indicate job-priorit [ citation needed ] Mainframes Main article Mainframe computer See also History of IBM mainframe operating systems Through the 1950s many major features were pioneered in the field of operating systems including batch processing input/output interrupt buffering multitasking spooling runtime libraries link-loading and programs for sorting records in file These features were included or not included in application software at the option of application programmers rather than in a separate operating system used by all application In 1959 the SHARE Operating System was released as an integrated utility for the IBM 704 and later in the 709 and 7090 mainframes although it was quickly supplanted by IBSYS IBJOB on the 709 7090 and 709 During the 1960s IBM s OS/360 introduced the concept of a single OS spanning an entire product line which was crucial for the success of the System/360 machine IBM s current mainframe operating systems are distant descendants of this original system and applications written for OS/360 can still be run on modern machine [ citation needed ] OS/360 also pioneered the concept that the operating system keeps track of all of the system resources that are used including program and data space allocation in main memory and file space in secondary storage and file locking during updat When the process is terminated for any reason all of these resources are re-claimed by the operating syste The alternative CP-67 system for the S/360-67 started a whole line of IBM operating systems focused on the concept of virtual machines Other operating systems used on IBM S/360 series mainframes included systems developed by IBM COS/360 Compatibility Operating System DOS/360 Disk Operating System TSS/360 Time Sharing System TOS/360 Tape Operating System BOS/360 Basic Operating System and ACP Airline Control Program as well as a few non-IBM systems MTS Michigan Terminal System MUSIC Multi-User System for Interactive Computing and ORVYL Stanford Timesharing System Control Data Corporation developed the SCOPE operating system in the 1960s for batch processing In cooperation with the University of Minnesota the Kronos and later the NOS operating systems were developed during the 1970s which supported simultaneous batch and timesharing us Like many commercial timesharing systems its interface was an extension of the Dartmouth BASIC operating systems one of the pioneering efforts in timesharing and programming language In the late 1970s Control Data and the University of Illinois developed the PLATO operating system which used plasma panel displays and long-distance time sharing network Plato was remarkably innovative for its time featuring real-time chat and multi-user graphical game Burroughs Corporation introduced the B5000 in 1961 with the MCP Master Control Program operating syste The B5000 was a stack machine designed to exclusively support high-level languages with no machine language or assembler and indeed the MCP was the first OS to be written exclusively in a high-level language ESPOL a dialect of ALGOL MCP also introduced many other ground-breaking innovations such as being the first commercial implementation of virtual memory During development of the AS400 IBM made an approach to Burroughs to licence MCP to run on the AS400 hardwar This proposal was declined by Burroughs management to protect its existing hardware productio MCP is still in use today in the Unisys ClearPath/MCP line of computer UNIVAC the first commercial computer manufacturer produced a series of EXEC operating system Like all early main-frame systems this was a batch-oriented system that managed magnetic drums disks card readers and line printer In the 1970s UNIVAC produced the Real-Time Basic RTB system to support large-scale time sharing also patterned after the Dartmouth BC syste General Electric and MIT developed General Electric Comprehensive Operating Supervisor GECOS which introduced the concept of ringed security privilege level After acquisition by Honeywell it was renamed to General Comprehensive Operating System GCOS Digital Equipment Corporation developed many operating systems for its various computer lines including TOPS-10 and TOPS-20 time sharing systems for the 36-bit PDP-10 class system Prior to the widespread use of UNIX TOPS-10 was a particularly popular system in universities and in the early ARPANET communit In the late 1960s through the late 1970s several hardware capabilities evolved that allowed similar or ported software to run on more than one syste Early systems had utilized microprogramming to implement features on their systems in order to permit different underlying computer architectures to appear to be the same as others in a serie In fact most 360s after the 360/40 except the 360/165 and 360/168 were microprogrammed implementation But soon other means of achieving application compatibility were proven to be more significan The enormous investment in software for these systems made since 1960s caused most of the original computer manufacturers to continue to develop compatible operating systems along with the hardwar The notable supported mainframe operating systems include Burroughs MCP B5000 1961 to Unisys Clearpath/MCP presen IBM OS/360 IBM System/360

OS that featured a command line interfac Mac OS by Apple Computer became the first widespread OS to feature a graphical user interface Many of its features such as windows and icons would later become commonplace in GUI The first microcomputers did not have the capacity or need for the elaborate operating systems that had been developed for mainframes and minis minimalistic operating systems were developed often loaded from ROM and known as monitors One notable early disk operating system was CP/M which was supported on many early microcomputers and was closely imitated by Microsoft s MS-DOS which became wildly popular as the operating system chosen for the IBM PC IBM s version of it was called IBM DOS or PC DOS In the 80s Apple Computer In now Apple In abandoned its popular Apple II series of microcomputers to introduce the Apple Macintosh computer with an innovative Graphical User Interface GUI to the Mac OS The introduction of the Intel 80386 CPU chip with 32-bit architecture and paging capabilities provided personal computers with the ability to run multitasking operating systems like those of earlier minicomputers and mainframes Microsoft responded to this progress by hiring Dave Cutler who had developed the VMS operating system for Digital Equipment Corporation He would lead the development of the Windows NT operating system which continues to serve as the basis for Microsoft s operating systems lin Steve Jobs a co-founder of Apple In started NeXT Computer Inc. which developed the NEXTSTEP operating syste NEXTSTEP would later be acquired by Apple In and used along with code from FreeBSD as the core of Mac OS The GNU Project was started by activist and programmer Richard Stallman with the goal of creating a complete free software replacement to the proprietary UNIX operating syste While the project was highly successful in duplicating the functionality of various parts of UNIX development of the GNU Hurd kernel proved to be unproductiv In 1991 Finnish computer science student Linus Torvalds with cooperation from volunteers collaborating over the Internet released the first version of the Linux kernel It was soon merged with the GNU user space components and system software to form a complete operating syste Since then the combination of the two major components has usually been referred to as simply Linux by the software industry a naming convention that Stallman and the Free Software Foundation remain opposed to preferring the name GNU/Linu The Berkeley Software Distribution known as BSD is the UNIX derivative distributed by the University of California Berkeley starting in the 1970 Freely distributed and ported to many minicomputers it eventually also gained a following for use on PCs mainly as FreeBSD NetBSD and OpenBSD Examples of operating systems UNIX and UNIX-like operating systems Evolution of Unix systems Main article Unix Ken Thompson wrote B mainly based on BCPL which he used to write Unix based on his experience in the MULTICS projec B was replaced by C and Unix developed into a large complex family of inter-related operating systems which have been influential in every modern operating system see History The UNIX-like family is a diverse group of operating systems with several major sub-categories including System V BSD and Linux The name UNIX is a trademark of The Open Group which licenses it for use with any operating system that has been shown to conform to their definition UNIX-like is commonly used to refer to the large set of operating systems which resemble the original UNI Unix-like systems run on a wide variety of computer architectures They are used heavily for servers in business as well as workstations in academic and engineering environment Free UNIX variants such as Linux and BSD are popular in these area Four operating systems are certified by the The Open Group holder of the Unix trademark as Uni HP s HP-UX and IBM s AIX are both descendants of the original System V Unix and are designed to run only on their respective vendor s hardwar In contrast Sun Microsystems s Solaris Operating System can run on multiple types of hardware including x86 and Sparc servers and PC Apple s Mac OS X a replacement for Apple s earlier non-Unix Mac OS is a hybrid kernel -based BSD variant derived from NeXTSTEP Mach and FreeBSD Unix interoperability was sought by establishing the POSIX standar The POSIX standard can be applied to any operating system although it was originally created for various Unix variant BSD and its descendants The first server for the World Wide Web ran on NeXTSTEP based on BS Main article Berkeley Software Distribution A subgroup of the Unix family is the Berkeley Software Distribution family which includes FreeBSD NetBSD and OpenBSD These operating systems are most commonly found on webservers although they can also function as a personal computer O The Internet owes much of its existence to BSD as many of the protocols now commonly used by computers to connect send and receive data over a network were widely implemented and refined in BS The world wide web was also first demonstrated on a number of computers running an OS based on BSD called NextStep BSD has its roots in Uni In 1974 University of California Berkeley installed its first Unix syste Over time students and staff in the computer science department there began adding new programs to make things easier such as text editor When Berkely received new VAX computers in 1978 with Unix installed the school s undergraduates modified Unix even more in order to take advantage of the computer s hardware possibilitie The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency of the US Department of Defense took interest and decided to fund the projec Many schools corporations and government organizations took notice and started to use Berkeley s version of Unix instead of the official one distributed by AT Steve Jobs upon leaving Apple In in 1985 formed NeXT In a company that manufactured high-end computers running on a variation of BSD called NeXTSTEP One of these computers was used by Tim Berners-Lee as the first webserver to create the World Wide We Developers like Keith Bostic encouraged the project to replace any non-free code that originated with Bell Lab Once this was done however ATT sue Eventually after two years of legal disputes the BSD project came out ahead and spawned a number of free derivatives such as FreeBSD and NetBSD OS X Main article OS X The standard user interface of Mac OS X Mac OS X is a line of open core graphical operating systems developed marketed and sold by Apple In the latest of which is pre-loaded on all currently shipping Macintosh computer Mac OS X is the successor to the original Mac OS which had been Apple s primary operating system since 198 Unlike its predecessor Mac OS X is a UNIX operating system built on technology that had been developed at NeXT through the second half of the 1980s and up until Apple purchased the company in early 199 The operating system was first released in 1999 as Mac OS X Server 1.0 with a desktop-oriented version Mac OS X v10.0 Cheetah following in March 200 Since then six more distinct client and server editions of Mac OS X have been released the most recent being OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion which was first made available on February 16 2012 for developers and was then released to the public on July 25 201 Releases of Mac OS X are named after big cats The server edition Mac OS X Server is architecturally identical to its desktop counterpart but usually runs on Apple s line of Macintosh server hardwar Mac OS X Server includes work group management and administration software tools that provide simplified access to key network services including a mail transfer agent a Samba server an LDAP server a domain name server and other In Mac OS X v10.7 Lion all server aspects of Mac OS X Server have been integrated into the client versio Linux and GNU Main articles GNU Linux and Linux kernel Ubuntu desktop Linux distribution Android a popular mobile operating system using the Linux kernel Linux or GNU/Linux is a Unix-like operating system that was developed without any actual Unix code unlike BSD and its variant Linux can be used on a wide range of devices from supercomputers to wristwatche The Linux kernel is released under an open source license so anyone can read and modify its cod It has been modified to run on a large variety of electronic Although estimates suggest that Linux is used on 1.82% of all personal computers it has been widely adopted for use in servers and embedded systems such as cell phones Linux has superseded Unix in most places [ which? ] and is used on the 10 most powerful supercomputers in the worl The Linux kernel is used in some popular distributions such as Red Hat Debian Ubuntu Linux Mint and Google s Android The GNU project is a mass collaboration of programmers who seek to create a completely free and open operating system that was similar to Unix but with completely original cod It was started in 1983 by Richard Stallman and is responsible for many of the parts of most Linux variant Thousands of pieces of software for virtually every operating system are licensed under the GNU General Public License Meanwhile the Linux kernel began as a side project of Linus Torvalds a university student from Finlan In 1991 Torvalds began work on it and posted information about his project on a newsgroup for computer students and programmer He received a wave of support and volunteers who ended up creating a full-fledged kerne Programmers from GNU took notice and members of both projects worked to integrate the finished GNU parts with the Linux kernel in order to create a full-fledged operating syste Google Chrome OS Main article Google Chrome OS Chrome is an operating system based on the Linux kernel and designed by Google Since Chrome OS targets computer users who spend most of their time on the Internet it is mainly a web browser with no ability to run application It relies on Internet applications or Web apps used in the web browser to accomplish tasks such as word processing and media viewing as well as online storage for storing most file Microsoft Windows Main article Microsoft Windows Bootable Windows To Go USB flash drive Microsoft Windows 7 Desktop Microsoft Windows is a family of proprietary operating systems designed by Microsoft Corporation and primarily targeted to Intel architecture based computers with an estimated 88.9 percent total usage share on Web connected computer The newest version is Windows 8 for workstations and Windows Server 2012 for server Windows 7 recently overtook Windows XP as most used O Microsoft Windows originated in 1985 as an operating environment running on top of MS-DOS which was the standard operating system shipped on most Intel architecture personal computers at the tim In 1995 Windows 95 was released which only used MS-DOS as a bootstra For backwards compatibility Win9x could run real-mode MS-DOS and 16 bits Windows 3.x driver Windows Me released in 2000 was the last version in the Win9x famil Later versions have all been based on the Windows NT kernel Current versions of Windows run on IA-32 and x86-64 microprocessors although Windows 8 will support ARM architectur In the past Windows NT supported non-Intel architecture Server editions of Windows are widely use In recent years Microsoft has expended significant capital in an effort to promote the use of Windows as a server operating system However Windows usage on servers is not as widespread as on personal computers as Windows competes against Linux and BSD for server market shar Other There have been many operating systems that were significant in their day but are no longer so such as AmigaOS OS/2 from IBM and Microsoft Mac OS the non-Unix precursor to Apple s Mac OS X BeOS XTS-300 RISC OS MorphOS and FreeMint Some are still used in niche markets and continue to be developed as minority platforms for enthusiast communities and specialist application OpenVMS formerly from DEC is still under active development by Hewlett-Packard Yet other operating systems are used almost exclusively in academia for operating systems education or to do research on operating system concept A typical example of a system that fulfills both roles is MINIX while for example Singularity is used purely for researc Other operating systems have failed to win significant market share but have introduced innovations that have influenced mainstream operating systems not least Bell Labs Plan 9 Components The components of an operating system all exist in order to make the different parts of a computer work togethe All user software needs to go through the operating system in order to use any of the hardware whether it be as simple as a mouse or keyboard or complex as an Internet connectio Kernel A kernel connects the application software to the hardware of a compute Main article Kernel computing With the aid of the firmware and device drivers the kernel provides the most basic level of control over all of the computer s hardware device It manages memory access for programs in the RAM it determines which programs get access to which hardware resources it sets up or resets the CPU s operating states for optimal operation at all times and it organizes the data for long-term non-volatile storage with file systems on such media as disks tapes flash memory et Program execution Main article Process computing The operating system provides an interface between an application program and the computer hardware so that an application program can interact with the hardware only by obeying rules and procedures programmed into the operating syste The operating system is also a set of services which simplify development and execution of application program Executing an application program involves the creation of a process by the operating system kernel which assigns memory space and other resources establishes a priority for the process in multi-tasking systems loads program binary code into memory and initiates execution of the application program which then interacts with the user and with hardware device Interrupts Main article Interrupt Interrupts are central to operating systems as they provide an efficient way for the operating system to interact with and react to its environmen The alternative having the operating system watch the various sources of input for events polling that require action can be found in older systems with very small stacks 50 or 60 bytes but are unusual in modern systems with large stack Interrupt -based programming is directly supported by most modern CPU Interrupts provide a computer with a way of automatically saving local register contexts and running specific code in response to event Even very basic computers support hardware interrupts and allow the programmer to specify code which may be run when that event takes plac When an interrupt is received the computer s hardware automatically suspends whatever program is currently running saves its status and runs computer code previously associated with the interrupt this is analogous to placing a bookmark in a book in response to a phone cal In modern operating systems interrupts are handled by the operating system s kernel Interrupts may come from either the computer s hardware or from the running progra When a hardware device triggers an interrupt the operating system s kernel decides how to deal with this event generally by running some processing cod The amount of code being run depends on the priority of the interrupt for example a person usually responds to a smoke detector alarm before answering the phone The processing of hardware interrupts is a task that is usually delegated to software called device driver which may be either part of the operating system s kernel part of another program or bot Device drivers may then relay information to a running program by various mean A program may also trigger an interrupt to the operating syste If a program wishes to access hardware for example it may interrupt the operating system s kernel which causes control to be passed back to the kerne The kernel will then process the reques If a program wishes additional resources or wishes to shed resources such as memory it will trigger an interrupt to get the kernel s attentio Modes Main articles Protected mode and Supervisor mode Privilege rings for the x86 available in protected mode Operating systems determine which processes run in each mod Modern CPUs support multiple modes of operatio CPUs with this capability use at least two modes protected mode and supervisor mode The supervisor mode is used by the operating system s kernel for low level tasks that need unrestricted access to hardware such as controlling how memory is written and erased and communication with devices like graphics card Protected mode in contrast is used for almost everything els Applications operate within protected mode and can only use hardware by communicating with the kernel which controls everything in supervisor mod CPUs might have other modes similar to protected mode as well such as the virtual modes in order to emulate older processor types such as 16-bit processors on a 32-bit one or 32-bit processors on a 64-bit on When a computer first starts up it is automatically running in supervisor mode The first few programs to run on the computer being the BIOS or EFI bootloader and the operating system have unlimited access to hardware - and this is required because by definition initializing a protected environment can only be done outside of on However when the operating system passes control to another program it can place the CPU into protected mode In protected mode programs may have access to a more limited set of the CPU s instruction A user program may leave protected mode only by triggering an interrupt causing control to be passed back to the kernel In this way the operating system can maintain exclusive control over things like access to hardware and memor The term protected mode resource generally refers to one or more CPU registers which contain information that the running program isn t allowed to alte Attempts to alter these resources generally causes a switch to supervisor mode where the operating system can deal with the illegal operation the program was attempting for example by killing the program Memory management Main article Memory management Among other things a multiprogramming operating system kernel must be responsible for managing all system memory which is currently in use by program This ensures that a program does not interfere with memory already in use by another progra Since programs time share each program must have independent access to memor Cooperative memory management used by many early operating systems assumes that all programs make voluntary use of the kernel s memory manager and do not exceed their allocated memor This system of memory management is almost never seen any more since programs often contain bugs which can cause them to exceed their allocated memor If a program fails it may cause memory used by one or more other programs to be affected or overwritte Malicious programs or viruses may purposefully alter another program s memory or may affect the operation of the operating system itsel With cooperative memory management it takes only one misbehaved program to crash the syste Memory protection enables the kernel to limit a process access to the computer s memor Various methods of memory protection exist including memory segmentation and paging All methods require some level of hardware support such as the 80286 MMU which doesn t exist in all computer In both segmentation and paging certain protected mode registers specify to the CPU what memory address it should allow a running program to acces Attempts to access other addresses will trigger an interrupt which will cause the CPU to re-enter supervisor mode placing the kernel in charg This is called a segmentation violation or Seg-V for short and since it is both difficult to assign a meaningful result to such an operation and because it is usually a sign of a misbehaving program the kernel will generally resort to terminating the offending program and will report the erro Windows 3.1-Me had some level of memory protection but programs could easily circumvent the need to use i A general protection fault would be produced indicating a segmentation violation had occurred however the system would often crash anywa Virtual memory Main article Virtual memory Further information Page fault Many operating systems can trick programs into using memory scattered around the hard disk and RAM as if it is one continuous chunk of memory called virtual memor The use of virtual memory addressing such as paging or segmentation means that the kernel can choose what memory each program may use at any given time allowing the operating system to use the same memory locations for multiple task If a program tries to access memory that isn t in its current range of accessible memory but nonetheless has been allocated to it the kernel will be interrupted in the same way as it would if the program were to exceed its allocated memor See section on memory managemen Under UNIX this kind of interrupt is referred to as a page fault When the kernel detects a page fault it will generally adjust the virtual memory range of the program which triggered it granting it access to the memory requeste This gives the kernel discretionary power over where a particular application s memory is stored or even whether or not it has actually been allocated ye In modern operating systems memory which is accessed less frequently can be temporarily stored on disk or other media to make that space available for use by other program This is called swapping as an area of memory can be used by multiple programs and what that memory area contains can be swapped or exchanged on deman Virtual memory provides the programmer or the user with the perception that there is a much larger amount of RAM in the computer than is really ther Multitasking Main articles Computer multitasking and Process management computing Further information Context switch Preemptive multitasking and Cooperative multitasking Multitasking refers to the running of multiple independent computer programs on the same computer giving the appearance that it is performing the tasks at the same tim Since most computers can do at most one or two things at one time this is generally done via time-sharing which means that each program uses a share of the computer s time to execut An operating system kernel contains a piece of software called a scheduler which determines how much time each program will spend executing and in which order execution control should be passed to program Control is passed to a process by the kernel which allows the program access to the CPU and memor Later control is returned to the kernel through some mechanism so that another program may be allowed to use the CP This so-called passing of control between the kernel and applications is called a context switch An early model which governed the allocation of time to programs was called cooperative multitasking In this model when control is passed to a program by the kernel it may execute for as long as it wants before explicitly returning control to the kerne This means that a malicious or malfunctioning program may not only prevent any other programs from using the CPU but it can hang the entire system if it enters an infinite loop Modern operating systems extend the concepts of application preemption to device drivers and kernel code so that the operating system has preemptive control over internal run-times as wel The philosophy governing preemptive multitasking is that of ensuring that all programs are given regular time on the CP This implies that all programs must be limited in how much time they are allowed to spend on the CPU without being interrupte To accomplish this modern operating system kernels make use of a timed interrup A protected mode timer is set by the kernel which triggers a return to supervisor mode after the specified time has elapse See above sections on Interrupts and Dual Mode Operatio On many single user operating systems cooperative multitasking is perfectly adequate as home computers generally run a small number of well tested program The AmigaOS is an exception having pre-emptive multitasking from its very first versio Windows NT was the first version of Microsoft Windows which enforced preemptive multitasking but it didn t reach the home user market until Windows XP since Windows NT was targeted at professionals Disk access and file systems Main article Virtual file system Filesystems allow users and programs to organize and sort files on a computer often through the use of directories or folders Access to data stored on disks is a central feature of all operating system Computers store data on disks using files which are structured in specific ways in order to allow for faster access higher reliability and to make better use out of the drive s available spac The specific way in which files are stored on a disk is called a file system and enables files to have names and attribute It also allows them to be stored in a hierarchy of directories or folders arranged in a directory tree Early operating systems generally supported a single type of disk drive and only one kind of file syste Early file systems were limited in their capacity speed and in the kinds of file names and directory structures they could us These limitations often reflected limitations in the operating systems they were designed for making it very difficult for an operating system to support more than one file syste While many simpler operating systems support a limited range of options for accessing storage systems operating systems like UNIX and Linux support a technology known as a virtual file system or VF An operating system such as UNIX supports a wide array of storage devices regardless of their design or file systems allowing them to be accessed through a common application programming interface API This makes it unnecessary for programs to have any knowledge about the device they are accessin A VFS allows the operating system to provide programs with access to an unlimited number of devices with an infinite variety of file systems installed on them through the use of specific device drivers and file system driver A connected storage device such as a hard drive is accessed through a device driver The device driver understands the specific language of the drive and is able to translate that language into a standard language used by the operating system to access all disk drive On UNIX this is the language of block devices When the kernel has an appropriate device driver in place it can then access the contents of the disk drive in raw format which may contain one or more file system A file system driver is used to translate the commands used to access each specific file system into a standard set of commands that the operating system can use to talk to all file system Programs can then deal with these file systems on the basis of filenames and directories/folders contained within a hierarchical structur They can create delete open and close files as well as gather various information about them including access permissions size free space and creation and modification date Various differences between file systems make supporting all file systems difficul Allowed characters in file names case sensitivity and the presence of various kinds of file attributes makes the implementation of a single interface for every file system a daunting tas Operating systems tend to recommend using and so support natively file systems specifically designed for them for example NTFS in Windows and ext3 and ReiserFS in Linu However in practice third party drives are usually available to give support for the most widely used file systems in most general-purpose operating systems for example NTFS is available in Linux through NTFS-3g and ext2/3 and ReiserFS are available in Windows through third-party software Support for file systems is highly varied among modern operating systems although there are several common file systems which almost all operating systems include support and drivers fo Operating systems vary on file system support and on the disk formats they may be installed o Under Windows each file system is usually limited in application to certain media for example CDs must use ISO 9660 or UDF and as of Windows Vista NTFS is the only file system which the operating system can be installed o It is possible to install Linux onto many types of file system Unlike other operating systems Linux and UNIX allow any file system to be used regardless of the media it is stored in whether it is a hard drive a disc CD,DVD. a USB flash drive or even contained within a file located on another file syste Device drivers Main article Device driver A device driver is a specific type of computer software developed to allow interaction with hardware device Typically this constitutes an interface for communicating with the device through the specific computer bus or communications subsystem that the hardware is connected to providing commands to and/or receiving data from the device and on the other end the requisite interfaces to the operating system and software application It is a specialized hardware-dependent computer program which is also operating system specific that enables another program typically an operating system or applications software package or computer program running under the operating system kernel to interact transparently with a hardware device and usually provides the requisite interrupt handling necessary for any necessary asynchronous time-dependent hardware interfacing need The key design goal of device drivers is abstraction Every model of hardware even within the same class of device is differen Newer models also are released by manufacturers that provide more reliable or better performance and these newer models are often controlled differentl Computers and their operating systems cannot be expected to know how to control every device both now and in the futur To solve this problem operating systems essentially dictate how every type of device should be controlle The function of the device driver is then to translate these operating system mandated function calls into device specific call In theory a new device which is controlled in a new manner should function correctly if a suitable driver is availabl This new driver will ensure that the device appears to operate as usual from the operating system s point of vie Under versions of Windows before Vista and versions of Linux before 2.6 all driver execution was co-operative meaning that if a driver entered an infinite loop it would freeze the syste More recent revisions of these operating systems incorporate kernel preemption where the kernel interrupts the driver to give it tasks and then separates itself from the process until it receives a response from the device driver or gives it more tasks to d Networking Main article Computer network Currently most operating systems support a variety of networking protocols hardware and applications for using the This means that computers running dissimilar operating systems can participate in a common network for sharing resources such as computing files printers and scanners using either wired or wireless connection Networks can essentially allow a computer s operating system to access the resources of a remote computer to support the same functions as it could if those resources were connected directly to the local compute This includes everything from simple communication to using networked file systems or even sharing another computer s graphics or sound hardwar Some network services allow the resources of a computer to be accessed transparently such as SSH which allows networked users direct access to a computer s command line interfac Client/server networking allows a program on a computer called a client to connect via a network to another computer called a serve Servers offer or host various services to other network computers and user These services are usually provided through ports or numbered access points beyond the server s network address Each port number is usually associated with a maximum of one running program which is responsible for handling requests to that por A daemon being a user program can in turn access the local hardware resources of that computer by passing requests to the operating system kerne Many operating systems support one or more vendor-specific or open networking protocols as well for example SNA on IBM systems DECnet on systems from Digital Equipment Corporation and Microsoft-specific protocols SMB on Window Specific protocols for specific tasks may also be supported such as NFS for file acces Protocols like ESound or esd can be easily extended over the network to provide sound from local applications on a remote system s sound hardwar Security Main article Computer security A computer being secure depends on a number of technologies working properl A modern operating system provides access to a number of resources which are available to software running on the system and to external devices like networks via the kerne The operating system must be capable of distinguishing between requests which should be allowed to be processed and others which should not be processe While some systems may simply distinguish between privileged and non-privileged systems commonly have a form of requester identity such as a user nam To establish identity there may be a process of authentication Often a username must be quoted and each username may have a passwor Other methods of authentication such as magnetic cards or biometric data might be used instea In some cases especially connections from the network resources may be accessed with no authentication at all such as reading files over a network share Also covered by the concept of requester identity is authorization the particular services and resources accessible by the requester once logged into a system are tied to either the requester s user account or to the variously configured groups of users to which the requester belong In addition to the allow/disallow model of security a system with a high level of security will also offer auditing option These would allow tracking of requests for access to resources such as who has been reading this file? Internal security or security from an already running program is only possible if all possibly harmful requests must be carried out through interrupts to the operating system kerne If programs can directly access hardware and resources they cannot be secure External security involves a request from outside the computer such as a login at a connected console or some kind of network connectio External requests are often passed through device drivers to the operating system s kernel where they can be passed onto applications or carried out directl Security of operating systems has long been a concern because of highly sensitive data held on computers both of a commercial and military natur The United States Government Department of Defense DoD created the Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria TCSEC which is a standard that sets basic requirements for assessing the effectiveness of securit This became of vital importance to operating system makers because the TCSEC was used to evaluate classify and select trusted operating systems being considered for the processing storage and retrieval of sensitive or classified information Network services include offerings such as file sharing print services email web sites and file transfer protocols FTP most of which can have compromised securit At the front line of security are hardware devices known as firewalls or intrusion detection/prevention system At the operating system level there are a number of software firewalls available as well as intrusion detection/prevention system Most modern operating systems include a software firewall which is enabled by defaul A software firewall can be configured to allow or deny network traffic to or from a service or application running on the operating syste Therefore one can install and be running an insecure service such as Telnet or FTP and not have to be threatened by a security breach because the firewall would deny all traffic trying to connect to the service on that por An alternative strategy and the only sandbox strategy available in systems that do not meet the Popek and Goldberg virtualization requirements is the operating system not running user programs as native code but instead either emulates a processor or provides a host for a p-code based system such as Jav Internal security is especially relevant for multi-user systems it allows each user of the system to have private files that the other users cannot tamper with or rea Internal security is also vital if auditing is to be of any use since a program can potentially bypass the operating system inclusive of bypassing auditin User interface A screenshot of the Bourne Again Shell command lin Each command is typed out after the prompt and then its output appears below working its way down the scree The current command prompt is at the botto Main article Operating system user interface Every computer that is to be operated by an individual requires a user interface The user interface is not actually a part of the operating system [ neutrality is disputed ] it generally runs in a separate program usually referred to as a shell but is essential if human interaction is to be supporte The user interface requests services from the operating system that will acquire data from input hardware devices such as a keyboard mouse or credit card reader and requests operating system services to display prompts status messages and such on output hardware devices such as a video monitor or printer The two most common forms of a user interface have historically been the command-line interface where computer commands are typed out line-by-line and the graphical user interface where a visual environment most commonly a WIMP is presen Graphical user interfaces A screenshot of the KDE Plasma Desktop graphical user interfac Programs take the form of images on the screen and the files folders directories and applications take the form of icons and symbol A mouse is used to navigate the compute Most of the modern computer systems support graphical user interfaces GUI and often include the In some computer systems such as the original implementation of Mac OS the GUI is integrated into the kernel While technically a graphical user interface is not an operating system service incorporating support for one into the operating system kernel can allow the GUI to be more responsive by reducing the number of context switches required for the GUI to perform its output function Other operating systems are modular separating the graphics subsystem from the kernel and the Operating Syste In the 1980s UNIX VMS and many others had operating systems that were built this wa Linux and Mac OS X are also built this wa Modern releases of Microsoft Windows such as Windows Vista implement a graphics subsystem that is mostly in user-space however the graphics drawing routines of versions between Windows NT 4.0 and Windows Server 2003 exist mostly in kernel spac Windows 9x had very little distinction between the interface and the kerne Many computer operating systems allow the user to install or create any user interface they desir The XWindow System in conjunction with GNOME or KDE Plasma Desktop is a commonly found setup on most Unix and Unix-like BSD Linux Solaris system A number of Windows shell replacements have been released for Microsoft Windows which offer alternatives to the included Windows shell but the shell itself cannot be separated from Window Numerous Unix-based GUIs have existed over time most derived from X1 Competition among the various vendors of Unix HP IBM Sun led to much fragmentation though an effort to standardize in the 1990s to COSE and CDE failed for various reasons and were eventually eclipsed by the widespread adoption of GNOME and K Desktop Environment Prior to free software -based toolkits and desktop environments Motif was the prevalent toolkit/desktop combination and was the basis upon which CDE was developed Graphical user interfaces evolve over tim For example Windows has modified its user interface almost every time a new major version of Windows is released and the MacOS GUI changed dramatically with the introduction of MacOSX in 199 Real-time operating systems Main article Real-time operating system A real-time operating system RTOS is a multitasking operating system intended for applications with fixed deadlines real-time computing Such applications include some small embedded systems automobile engine controllers industrial robots spacecraft industrial control and some large-scale computing system An early example of a large-scale real-time operating system was Transaction Processing Facility developed by American Airlines and IBM for the Sabre Airline Reservations System Embedded systems that have fixed deadlines use a real-time operating system such as VxWorks PikeOS eCos QNX MontaVista Linux and RTLinux Windows CE is a real-time operating system that shares similar APIs to desktop Windows but shares none of desktop Windows codebas [ citation needed ] Symbian OS also has an RTOS kernel EKA2 starting with version 8.0 Some embedded systems use operating systems such as Palm OS BSD and Linux although such operating systems do not support real-time computin Operating system development as a hobby See also Hobbyist operating system development Operating system development is one of the most complicated activities in which a computing hobbyist may engag A hobby operating system may be classified as one whose code has not been directly derived from an existing operating system and has few users and active developers In some cases hobby development is in support of a homebrew computing device for example a simple single-board computer powered by a 6502 microprocessor Or development may be for an architecture already in widespread us Operating system development may come from entirely new concepts or may commence by modeling an existing operating syste In either case the hobbyist is his/her own developer or may interact with a small and sometimes unstructured group of individuals who have like interest Examples of a hobby operating system include ReactOS and Syllable Diversity of operating systems and portability Application software is generally written for use on a specific operating system and sometimes even for specific hardwar When porting the application to run on another OS the functionality required by that application may be implemented differently by that OS the names of functions meaning of arguments et requiring the application to be adapted changed or otherwise maintained This cost in supporting operating systems diversity can be avoided by instead writing applications against software platforms like Java or Qt These abstractions have already borne the cost of adaptation to specific operating systems and their system libraries Another approach is for operating system vendors to adopt standard For example POSIX and OS abstraction layers provide commonalities that reduce porting cost See also Comparison of operating systems Handheld computers
