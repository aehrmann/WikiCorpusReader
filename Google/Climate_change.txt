periods ranging from decades to millions of year It may be a change in average weather conditions or in the distribution of weather around the average conditions i.e. more or fewer extreme weather events Climate change is caused by factors that include oceanic processes such as oceanic circulation variations in solar radiation received by Earth plate tectonics and volcanic eruptions and human-induced alterations of the natural world these latter effects are currently causing global warming and climate change is often used to describe human-specific impact Scientists actively work to understand past and future climate by using observations and theoretical model Borehole temperature profiles ice cores floral and faunal records glacial and periglacial processes stable isotope and other sediment analyses and sea level records serve to provide a climate record that spans the geologic pas More recent data are provided by the instrumental recor Physically based general circulation

change in the statistical properties of the climate system when considered over long periods of time regardless of caus Accordingly fluctuations over periods shorter than a few decades such as El Nio do not represent climate chang The term sometimes is used to refer specifically to climate change caused by human activity as opposed to changes in climate that may have resulted as part of Earth s natural processe In this sense especially in the context of environmental policy the term climate change has become synonymous with anthropogenic global warming Within scientific journals global warming refers to surface temperature increases while climate change includes global warming and everything else that increasing greenhouse gas levels will affec Causes On the broadest scale the rate at which energy is received from the sun and the rate at which it is lost to space determine the equilibrium temperature and climate of Eart This energy is distributed around the globe by winds ocean currents and other mechanisms to affect the climates of different region Factors that can shape climate are called climate forcings or forcing mechanisms These include processes such as variations in solar radiation variations in the Earth s orbit mountain-building and continental drift and changes in greenhouse gas concentration There are a variety of climate change feedbacks that can either amplify or diminish the initial forcin Some parts of the climate system such as the oceans and ice caps respond slowly in reaction to climate forcings while others respond more quickl Forcing mechanisms can be either internal or external Internal forcing mechanisms are natural processes within the climate system itself e.g. the thermohaline circulation External forcing mechanisms can be either natural e.g. changes in solar output or anthropogenic e.g. increased emissions of greenhouse gases Whether the initial forcing mechanism is internal or external the response of the climate system might be fast e.g. a sudden cooling due to airborne volcanic ash reflecting sunlight slow e. thermal expansion of warming ocean water or a combination e.g. sudden loss of albedo in the arctic ocean as sea ice melts followed by more gradual thermal expansion of the water Therefore the climate system can respond abruptly but the full response to forcing mechanisms might not be fully developed for centuries or even longe Internal forcing mechanisms Natural changes in the components of Earth s climate system and their interactions are the cause of internal climate variability or internal forcing Scientists generally define the five components of earth s climate system to include atmosphere hydrosphere cryosphere lithosphere restricted to the surface soils rocks and sediments and biosphere [ citation needed ] Ocean variability Pacific Decadal Oscillation 1925 to 2010 Main article Thermohaline circulation The ocean is a fundamental part of the climate system some changes in it occurring at longer timescales than in the atmosphere massing hundreds of times more and having very high thermal inertia such as the ocean depths still lagging today in temperature adjustment from the Little Ice Age Short-term fluctuations years to a few decades such as the El Nio-Southern Oscillation the Pacific decadal oscillation the North Atlantic oscillation and the Arctic oscillation represent climate variability rather than climate chang On longer time scales alterations to ocean processes such as thermohaline circulation play a key role in redistributing heat by carrying out a very slow and extremely deep movement of water and the long-term redistribution of heat in the world s ocean A schematic of modern thermohaline circulatio Tens of millions of years ago continental plate movement formed a land-free gap around Antarctica allowing formation of the ACC which keeps warm waters away from Antarctic External forcing mechanisms Increase in atmospheric CO 2 levels Milankovitch cycles from 800,000 years ago in the past to 800,000 years in the futur Variations in CO 2 temperature and dust from the Vostok ice core over the last 450,000 years Orbital variations Main article Milankovitch cycles Slight variations in Earth s orbit lead to changes in the seasonal distribution of sunlight reaching the Earth s surface and how it is distributed across the glob There is very little change to the area-averaged annually averaged sunshine but there can be strong changes in the geographical and seasonal distributio The three types of orbital variations are variations in Earth s eccentricity changes in the tilt angle of Earth s axis of rotation and precession of Earth s axi Combined together these produce Milankovitch cycles which have a large impact on climate and are notable for their correlation to glacial and interglacial periods their correlation with the advance and retreat of the Sahara and for their appearance in the stratigraphic record The IPCC notes that Milankovitch cycles drove the ice age cycles CO 2 followed temperature change with a lag of some hundreds of years and that as a feedback amplified temperature chang The depths of the ocean have a lag time in changing temperature thermal inertia on such scale Upon seawater temperature change the solubility of CO 2 in the oceans changed as well as other factors impacting air-sea CO 2 exchang Solar output Main article Solar variation Variations in solar activity during the last several centuries based on observations of sunspots and beryllium isotope The period of extraordinarily few sunspots in the late 17th century was the Maunder minimum The Sun is the predominant source for energy input to the Eart Both long- and short-term variations in solar intensity are known to affect global climat Three to four billion years ago the sun emitted only 70% as much power as it does toda If the atmospheric composition had been the same as today liquid water should not have existed on Eart However there is evidence for the presence of water on the early Earth in the Hadean and Archean eons leading to what is known as the faint young Sun paradox Hypothesized solutions to this paradox include a vastly different atmosphere with much higher concentrations of greenhouse gases than currently exis Over the following approximately 4 billion years the energy output of the sun increased and atmospheric composition change The Great Oxygenation Event oxygenation of the atmosphere around 2.4 billion years ago was the most notable alteratio Over the next five billion years the sun s ultimate death as it becomes a red giant and then a white dwarf will have large effects on climate with the red giant phase possibly ending any life on Earth that survives until that tim Solar output also varies on shorter time scales including the 11-year solar cycle and longer-term modulations Solar intensity variations are considered to have been influential in triggering the Little Ice Age and some of the warming observed from 1900 to 195 The cyclical nature of the sun s energy output is not yet fully understood it differs from the very slow change that is happening within the sun as it ages and evolve Research indicates that solar variability has had effects including the Maunder minimum from 1645 to 1715 A. part of the Little Ice Age from 1550 to 1850 A. which was marked by relative cooling and greater glacier extent than the centuries before and afterwar Some studies point toward solar radiation increases from cyclical sunspot activity affecting global warming and

throughout the atmosphere may be contrary to current expectation In an Aug 2011 Press Release CERN announced the publication in the Nature journal the initial results from its CLOUD experimen The results indicate that ionisation from cosmic rays significantly enhances aerosol formation in the presence of sulphuric acid and water but in the lower atmosphere where ammonia is also required this is insufficient to account for aerosol formation and additional trace vapours must be involve The next step is to find more about these trace vapours including whether they are of natural or human

occur on average several times per century and cause cooling by partially blocking the transmission of solar radiation to the Earth s surface for a period of a few year The eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 the second largest terrestrial eruption of the 20th century after the 1912 eruption of Novarupta affected the climate substantiall Global temperatures decreased by about 0.5 C 0.9 F The eruption of Mount Tambora in 1815 caused the Year Without a Summer Much larger eruptions known as large igneous provinces occur only a few times every hundred million years but may cause global warming and mass extinctions Volcanoes are also part of the extended carbon cycle Over very long geological time periods they release carbon dioxide from the Earth s crust and mantle counteracting the uptake by sedimentary rocks and other geological carbon dioxide sinks The US Geological Survey estimates are that volcanic emissions are at a much lower level than the effects of current human activities which generate 100-300 times the amount of carbon dioxide emitted by volcanoe A review of published studies indicates that annual volcanic emissions of carbon dioxide including amounts released from mid-ocean ridges volcanic arcs and hot spot volcanoes are only the equivalent of 3 to 5 days of human caused outpu The annual amount put out by human activities may be greater than the amount released by supererruptions the most recent of which was the Toba eruption in Indonesia 74,000 years ag Although volcanoes are technically part of the lithosphere which itself is part of the climate system the IPCC explicitly defines volcanism as an external forcing agen Plate tectonics Over the course of millions of years the motion of tectonic plates reconfigures global land and ocean areas and generates topograph This can affect both global and local patterns of climate and atmosphere-ocean circulatio The position of the continents determines the geometry of the oceans and therefore influences patterns of ocean circulatio The locations of the seas are important in controlling the transfer of heat and moisture across the globe and therefore in determining global climat A recent example of tectonic control on ocean circulation is the formation of the Isthmus of Panama about 5 million years ago which shut off direct mixing between the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean This strongly affected the ocean dynamics of what is now the Gulf Stream and may have led to Northern Hemisphere ice cove During the Carboniferous period about 300 to 360 million years ago plate tectonics may have triggered large-scale storage of carbon and increased glaciation Geologic evidence points to a megamonsoonal circulation pattern during the time of the supercontinent Pangaea and climate

several smaller continents or islands Human influences Main article Global warming Main article Climate change mitigation In the context of climate variation anthropogenic factors are human activities which affect the climat The scientific consensus on climate change is that climate is changing and that these changes are in large part caused by human activities and it is largely irreversibl Science has made enormous inroads in understanding climate change and its causes and is beginning to help develop a strong understanding of current and potential impacts that will affect people today and in coming decade This understanding is crucial because it allows decision makers to place climate change in the context of other large challenges facing the nation and the worl There are still some uncertainties and there always will be in understanding a complex system like Earths climat Nevertheless there is a strong credible body of evidence based on multiple lines of research documenting that climate is changing and that these changes are in large part caused by human activitie While much remains to be learned the core phenomenon scientific questions and hypotheses have been examined thoroughly and have stood firm in the face of serious scientific debate and careful evaluation of alternative explanation United States National Research Council Advancing the Science of Climate

effects have been linked to the collapse of various civilization Decline in thickness of glaciers worldwide over the past half-century Glaciers Glaciers are considered among the most sensitive indicators of climate chang Their size is determined by a mass balance between snow input and melt outpu As temperatures warm glaciers retreat unless snow precipitation increases to make up for the additional melt the converse is also tru Glaciers grow and shrink due both to natural variability and external forcing Variability in temperature precipitation and englacial and subglacial hydrology can strongly determine the evolution of a glacier in a particular seaso Therefore one must average over a decadal or longer time-scale and/or over a many individual glaciers to smooth out the local short-term variability and obtain a glacier history that is related to climat A world glacier inventory has been compiled since the 1970s initially based mainly on aerial photographs and maps but now relying more on satellite This compilation tracks more than 100,000 glaciers covering a total area of approximately 240,000km 2 and preliminary estimates indicate that the remaining ice cover is around 445,000km 2 The World Glacier Monitoring Service collects data annually on glacier retreat and glacier mass balance From this data glaciers worldwide have been found to be shrinking significantly with strong glacier retreats in the 1940s stable or growing conditions during the 1920s and 1970s and again retreating from the mid 1980s to presen The most significant climate processes since the middle to late Pliocene approximately 3 million years ago are the glacial and interglacial cycle The present interglacial period the Holocene has lasted about 11,700 year Shaped by orbital variations responses such as the rise and fall of continental ice sheets and significant sea-level changes helped create the climat Other changes including Heinrich events DansgaardOeschger events and

growt Vegetation A change in the type distribution and coverage of vegetation may occur given a change in the climat Some changes in climate may result in increased precipitation and warmth resulting in improved plant growth and the subsequent sequestration of airborne CO 2 A gradual increase in warmth in a region will lead to earlier flowering and fruiting times driving a change in the timing of life cycles of dependent organism Conversely cold will cause plant bio-cycles to la Larger faster or more radical changes however may result in vegetation stress rapid plant loss and desertification

plant species which vary under different climate condition Different groups of plants have pollen with distinctive shapes and surface textures and since the outer surface of pollen is composed of a
