actin Earlier experiences are considered free from prejudices there is an interest and motivation to continue learning Conflict of laws Main article Conflict of laws Conflict of laws is a set of procedural rules that determines which legal system and which jurisdiction s applies to a given disput The term conflict of laws itself originates from situations where the ultimate outcome of a legal dispute depended upon which law applied and the common law courts manner of resolving the conflict between those law In civil law lawyers and legal scholars refer to conflict of laws as private international la Private international law has no real connection with public international law and is instead a feature of local law which varies from country to countr The three branches of conflict of laws are Jurisdiction whether the forum court has the power to resolve the dispute at hand Choice of law the law which is being applied to resolve the dispute Foreign judgments the ability to recognize and enforce a judgment from an external forum within the jurisdiction of the adjudicating forum Globalization Multinational corporations are important factors in the processes of globalization National and local governments often compete against one another to attract MNC facilities with the expectation of increased tax revenue employment and economic activit To compete political entities may offer MNCs incentives such as tax breaks pledges of governmental assistance or subsidized infrastructure or lax environmental and labor regulation These ways of attracting foreign investment may be criticized as a race to the bottom a push towards greater autonomy for corporations or bot MNCs play an important role in developing the economies of developing countries like investing in these countries provide market to the MNC but provide employment choice of multi goods et On the other hand economist Jagdish Bhagwati has argued that in countries with comparatively low labor costs and weak environmental and social protection multinationals actually bring about a race to the to While multinationals will certainly see a low tax burden or low labor costs as an element of comparative advantage Bhagwati disputes the existence of evidence suggesting that MNCs deliberately avail themselves of lax environmental regulation or poor labor standard As Bhagwati has pointed out MNC profits are tied to operational efficiency which includes a high degree of standardisatio Thus MNCs are likely to adapt production processes in many of their operations to conform to the standards of the most rigorous jurisdiction in which they operate this tends to be either the USA Japan or the EU As for labor costs while MNCs clearly pay workers in developing countries far below levels in countries where labor productivity is high and accordingly will adopt more labor-intensive production processes they also tend to pay a premium over local labor rates of 10 to 100 percen Finally depending on the nature of the MNC investment in any country reflects a desire for a medium- to long-term return as establishing plant training workers etc. can be costl Once established in a jurisdiction therefore MNCs are potentially vulnerable to arbitrary government intervention such as expropriation sudden contract renegotiation the arbitrary withdrawal or compulsory purchase of licenses et Thus both the negotiating power of MNCs and the race to the bottom critique may be overstated while understating the benefits besides tax revenue of MNCs becoming established in a jurisdictio Transnational Corporations A Transnational Corporation TNC differs from a traditional MNC in that it does not identify itself with one national hom Whilst traditional MNCs are national companies with foreign subsidiaries TNCs spread out their operations in many countries sustaining high levels of local responsivenes An example of a TNC is Nestl who employ senior executives from many countries and try to make decisions from a global perspective rather than from one centralized headquarter However the terms TNC and MNC are often used interchangeabl Criticism of multinationals Main articles Anti-globalization and Anti-corporate activism Anti-corporate advocates criticize multinational corporations for entering countries that have low human rights or environmental standard They claim that multinationals give rise to huge merged conglomerations that reduce competition and free enterprise raise capital in host countries but export the profits exploit countries for their natural resources limit workers wages erode traditional cultures and challenge national sovereignt See also Globalization Global workforce List of multinational
