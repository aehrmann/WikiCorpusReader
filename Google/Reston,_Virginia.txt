birthday and named for his initials it was the first modern post-war planned community in America sparking a revival of the planned community concep Simon s family had recently sold Carnegie Hall and

Library Reston Hospital Center and The Embry Rucker Community Shelter are located nearb The Reston police sub-station is also the office headquarters of the locally elected supervisor of the Hunter Mill District within the Fairfax County Board of Supervisor Reston experienced increasing traffic congestion as it grew in the late 1970s and early 1980 This was a time when Reston s population was growing but the Dulles Toll Road had not been buil Commuter traffic between Reston and Washington created serious traffic congestion on the roads that connected Reston to Washington D In 1984 the toll road opened and in 1986 the West Falls Church Washington Metro station opene Most recently the Fairfax County Parkway a major north-south artery was opene Reston is one of just a handful of communities in the U. that has been designated a backyard wildlife habitat communit Usually this designation is for single-family home Reston has grown to a point where it now fits the definition of an edge city While Reston takes on the statistical properties of an edge city its tightly controlled design averted several problems they typically face such as hostile pedestrian situations and lack of mass transit Many of the neighborhoods in Reston were designed to be medium density which is atypical of an edge cit In other ways it is a textbook example with a majority of medium rise office buildings and some citizens opposed to the expansion of its high density cor Ebola virus scare Main article Reston virus A filovirus at first suspected to be Ebola virus EBOV was discovered among crab-eating macaques Macaca fascicularis within the Covance Primate Quarantine Unit in 198 This attracted significant media attention including the publication of The Hot Zone The filovirus was found to be distinct from EBOV and to be nonpathogenic for human It was named after the community and is now known as Reston virus RESTV Macaques found to be or suspected to be infected with RESTV were euthanized and the facility was sterilize The facility was located in an office park near Sunset Hills Road and Wiehle Avenu It was eventually torn down and a daycare was built in its plac Guiding principles Part of the New Town movement from the beginning Reston was designed to follow guiding principles in its development that would stress quality of lif Citizens would be able to live in the same community while going through different life cycles with different housing needs as they ag It was hoped that Restonians could live work and have recreation in their own community with common grounds and scenic beauty shared equally regardless of income leve Beyond the influence of the New Town movement Reston was part of a back-to-the-land movement popular in the 1960s and early 1970 The principles incorporated in the community can be seen as a reaction to the new suburban communities of the post-war era e.g. Levittown Among the problems in these communities that Reston responded to included income segregation a lack of natural preservation suburbs that served only as bedroom communities for commuters a lack of public space in new developments and a lack of community ties in new development Many early residents settled in Reston because of the ideals of the communit Reston was planned with the following principles as stated by Robert Simon in 1962 In the creation of Reston Virginia these are the major goals That the widest choice of opportunities be made available for the full use of leisure tim This means that the New Town should provide a wide range of cultural and recreational facilities as well as an environment for privac That it be possible for anyone to remain in a single neighborhood throughout his life uprooting being neither inevitable nor always desirabl By providing the fullest range of housing styles and prices from high-rise efficiencies to 6-bedroom townhouses and detached houses housing needs can be met at a variety of income levels and at different stages of family lif This kind of mixture permits residents to remain rooted in the community if they so choose as their particular housing needs chang As a by-product this also results in the heterogeneity that spells a lively and varied communit That the importance and dignity of each individual be the focal point for all planning and take precedence for large-scale concept That the people be able to live and work in the same communit That commercial cultural and recreational facilities be made available to the residents from the outset of the development not years late That beauty structural and natural is a necessity of the good life and should be fostere Since Reston is being developed from private enterprise in order to be completed as conceived it must also of course be a financial succes The Reston Concept New Town Related communities Greenbelt Maryland a 1930s community built as part of a federal New Deal housing experiment is another example of a New Tow Subsequent New Town movement communities include Roosevelt Island in New York City and Columbia Maryland Firsts Reston was the first post-war community in the U. to use clustered townhouse development a strategy that allows for the preservation of open space along with higher densit Reston was also the first 20th-century private community in the U. to incorporate natural preservation in its planning Greenbelt was a publicly-supported community Town and village centers An important part of Reston s development is its five village centers and one town cente Each village center all of which save North Point predate the Reston Town Center was designed to be a half-mile walk from most homes and incorporate the daily retail and community service needs of resident Denser developments such as apartments and clustered town homes are clustered around each village cente The first village center built was the critically acclaimed Lake Anne see below followed by in chronological order Hunters Woods Tall Oaks South Lakes and North Poin New urbanism Reston was planned before the term new urbanism entered into mainstream use but it follows new urbanism guidelines in a number of way Reston was built with an extensive path system and recently Fairfax County has constructed many sidewalk It is possible to bike to downtown Reston in 15 minutes from most location The downtown and original areas also incorporate mixed-use development Further mixed-use development is planned for areas where future Metro stations will be locate However Reston differs from New Urbanism principles in several important way Almost all buildings are oriented away from main streets and few major arteries have complete sidewalk networks although pedestrian and bike travel is easily accomplished on the isolated nature paths referred to abov This is a result of Fairfax County controlling Reston s transportation planninguntil recently the Fairfax County zoning code only required sidewalks to be built by developers in certain case The inward orientation of buildings was a preference of the early developers of Reston who wished to avoid the commercial strip look that dominates many suburban developments in favor of a more naturalistic loo In addition the Dulles Toll Road Corridor of office parks cuts a half-mile wide swath across the community with only five north-south connections making cross-town travel by car and foot difficul The creation of a sixth connection at Soapstone Drive has been talked about in the past by planners and the creation of mixed-use developments around planned Metro Stations may help better-knit the community togethe Cultural and other activities A special tax district within Fairfax County was created to fund the various educational cultural and

value of the property as determined by Fairfax Count The Voluntary City notes that this may have been an attempt to imitate local government However it argues that it would have been better to assess all property owners the same amount for three reason First the public goods that residents enjoy are not likely to be dependent on the value of the property they occup Second the tax structure is factored into the price of the property thus an inexpensive home saddled with higher assessments would become even more inexpensive because its value would be diminished by the tying of these payments to the propert Third payments based on assessed value dampen the incentive to improve the value of the propert Reston has a federal system of government in which cluster associations form around
