Stanford It is named in honor of their only child Leland Stanford J who died in 1884 just before his 16th birthda His parents decided to dedicate a university to their only son and Leland Stanford told his wife The children of California shall be our childre The Stanfords visited Harvard s president Charles Eliot and asked how much it would cost to duplicate Harvard in California Eliot replied that he supposed $15 million in 1884 dollars would be enoug Leland Stanford the university s founder as painted by Jean-Louis-Ernest Meissonier in 1881 and now on display at the Cantor Center The university s founding Grant of Endowment from the Stanfords was issued in November 188 Besides defining the operational structure of the university it made several specific stipulations The Trustees shall have the power and it shall be their duty To establish and maintain at such University an educational system which will if followed fit the graduate for some useful pursuit and to this end to cause the pupils as easily as may be to declare the particular calling which in life they may desire to pursue To prohibit sectarian instruction but to have taught in the University the immortality of the soul the existence of an all-wise and benevolent Creator and that obedience to His laws is the highest duty of ma To have taught in the University the right and advantages of association and co-operatio To afford equal facilities and give equal advantages in the University to both sexe To maintain on the Palo Alto estate a farm for instruction in agriculture in all its branche The Stanfords chose their country estate Palo Alto Stock Farm in Santa Clara County as the site of the university so that the University is sometimes called the Farm to this da [ note 2 ] The original inner quad buildings 188791 were designed by Frederick Law Olmsted Francis Walker Charles Allerton Coolidge and Leland Stanford himsel Visiting Stanford in 1903 President Theodore Roosevelt said of the campus and the university Now I have come to this great institution of learning and I wonder whether you yourselves fully appreciate the mere physical beauty of your surrounding I was not prepared in the least and I thought I was prepared for it for the beauty of your surrounding You have had these plans of your university made by a great architect native to our own American soil who himself had the sense to adaptnot to copy in servile fashionbut to adapt the old Californian architecture to the new university uses and so we have here a great institution of learning absolutely unique even in its outward aspect situated in this beautiful valley with the hills in the background under this sky with these buildings and if this university does not turn out the right kind of citizenship and the right kind of scholarship I shall be more than disappointe An arcade in Stanford s main quad in the early 20th century In Spring 1891 the Stanfords offered the presidency of their new university to the president of Cornell University Andrew White but he declined and recommended David Starr Jordan the 40-year-old president of Indiana University Bloomington Jordan s educational philosophy was a good fit with the Stanfords vision of a non-sectarian co-educational school with a liberal arts curriculum and he accepted the offe Jordan arrived at Stanford in June 1891 and immediately set about recruiting faculty for the university s planned October openin With such a short time frame he drew heavily on his own acquaintance in academia of the fifteen original professors most came either from Indiana University or his alma mater Cornel The 1891 founding professors included Robert Allardice in mathematics Douglas Houghton Campbell in botany Charles Henry Gilbert in zoology George Elliott Howard in history Oliver Peebles Jenkins in physiology and histology Charles David Marx in civil engineering Fernando Sanford in physics and John Maxson Stillman in chemistr The total initial teaching staff numbered about 35 including instructors and lecturer For the second 189293 school year Jordan was able to add additional professors including Frank Angell psychology Leander Hoskins mechanical engineering Walter Miller classics George Price zoology and Arly Show history Most of these two founding groups of professors remained at Stanford until their retirement and were referred to as the Old Guard The university officially opened on October 1 1891 to 559 student On the university s opening day Founding President David Starr Jordan said to Stanford s Pioneer Class [Stanford] is hallowed by no traditions it is hampered by non Its finger posts all point forwar Herbert Hoover and his future wife Lou Henry Hoover were in the first class the Hoovers maintained close lifetime ties to the schoo The motto of Stanford University selected by President Jordan is Die Luft der Freiheit weh Translated from the German language this quotation from Ulrich von Hutten means The wind of freedom blow The motto was controversial during World War I when anything in German was suspect at that time the university disavowed that this motto was officia Coeducation The school was established as a coeducational institutio However Jane Stanford soon put a policy in place limiting female enrollment to 500 students because of the large number of women students enrollin She did not want the school to become the Vassar of the West because she felt that would not be an appropriate memorial for her so In 1933 the policy was modified to specify an undergraduate male female ratio of 3 The Stanford ratio of 3 1 remained in place until the early 1960 By the late 1960s the ratio was about 2 1 for undergraduates but much more skewed at the graduate level except in the humanitie As of 2005 the school no longer maintains a gender preference policy and undergraduate enrollment is split nearly evenly between the sexes though males outnumber females about 2 1 at the graduate level exclusive of Humanitie Early finances When Leland Stanford died in 1893 the continued existence of the university was in jeopard A $15 million government lawsuit against Stanford s estate combined with the Panic of 1893 made it extremely difficult to meet expense Most of the Board of Trustees advised a temporary closing until finances could be sorted ou However Jane Stanford insisted that the university remain in operatio Faced with the possibility of financial ruin for the University she took charge of financial administrative and development matters at the university 1893-1905 from her experience as a mother and housewife she ran the institution as a househol For the next several years she paid salaries out of her personal resources even pawning her jewelry to keep the university goin When the lawsuit was finally dropped in 1895 a university holiday was declare Stanford alumnus George Crothers became a close adviser to Jane Stanford following his graduation from Stanford s law school in 189 Working with his brother Thomas also a Stanford graduate and a lawyer Crothers identified and corrected numerous major legal defects in the terms of the university s founding grant and successfully lobbied for an amendment to the California state constitution granting Stanford an exemption from taxation on its educational propertya change which allowed Jane Stanford to donate her stock holdings to the universit Edward Alsworth Ross gained fame as a founding father of American sociology in 1900 Jane Stanford fired him for radicalism and racism unleashing a major academic freedom cas Jane Stanford s actions were sometimes eccentri In 1897 she directed the board of trustees that the students be taught that everyone born on earth has a soul germ and that on its development depends much in life here and everything in Life Eternal She forbade students from sketching nude models in life-drawing class banned automobiles from campus and did not allow a hospital to be constructed so that people would not form an impression that Stanford was unhealth Between 1899 and 1905 she spent $3 million on a grand construction scheme building lavish memorials to the Stanford family while university faculty and self-supporting students were living in povert However in 1901 she transferred $30 million in assets nearly all her remaining wealth to the university upon her death in 1905 she left the university nearly $4 million of her remaining $7 millio In total the Stanfords donated around $40 million in assets to the university over $1 billion in 2010 dollars 20th century The ruins of the unfinished Stanford Library after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake The 1906 San Francisco earthquake destroyed parts of the Main Quad including the original iteration of Memorial Church as well as the gate that first marked the entrance of the school rebuilding on a somewhat less grandiose scale began immediatel In 1931 Stanford and Harvard University participated in the first ever intercollegiate radio debat Football From 1906 to 1919 in response to the crisis caused by numerous injuries intercollegiate football was in jeopard While some colleges dropped football entirely a few such as the University of California and Stanford University replaced it with English rugb From 1906 to 1914 the two schools played rugby as their major sport but they soon found that the objectionable practices they saw in football were introduced into rugb Finally when the football rules were changed a move developed to return to football reviving intercollegiate sports and enabling students and alumni to identify with football an American spor Hoover Institution The Hoover Institution Library and Archives official name Hoover Institution on War Revolution and Peace at Stanford was set up in 1920 by Herbert Hoover one of Stanford s first graduate He had been in charge of American relief efforts in Europe after World War I before his election as President of the United States in 192 Hoover s express purpose was to collect the records of contemporary history as it was happenin Hoover s helpers frequently risked their lives to rescue documentary and rare printed material especially from countries under Nazi or Communist rul Their many successes included the papers of Rosa Luxemburg the Goebbels diaries and the records of the Russian secret police in Pari Research institutes were also set up under Hoover s influence though inevitably there were to be clashes between the moving force Hoover and the host universit In 1960 Glenn Campbell was appointed director and substantial budget increases soon led to corresponding increases in acquisitions and related research project Despite student unrest in the 1960s the institution continued to thrive and develop closer relations with Stanfor In particular the Chinese and Russian collections grew considerabl From the 1980s forward the Hoover Institution itself evolved into a conservative think tank functioning independently from the library and archiv It continues as an integral component of the Universit Post-1945 Biology The biological sciences department evolved rapidly from 1946 to 1972 as its research focus changed due to the Cold War and other historically significant conditions external to academi Stanford science went through three phases of experimental direction during that tim In the early 1950s the department remained fixed in the classical independent and self-directed research mode shunning interdisciplinary collaboration and excessive government fundin Between the 1950s and mid-1960s biological research shifted focus to the molecular leve Then from the late 1960s onward Stanford s goal became applying research and findings toward humanistic end Each phase was preempted by larger social issues such as the escalation of the Cold War the launch of Sputnik and public concern over medical abuses In 1971 professor Philip Zimbardo conducted the Stanford Prison Experiment High tech A powerful sense of regional solidarity accompanied the rise of Silicon Valle From the 1890s the university s leaders saw its mission as service to the West and shaped the school accordingl At the same time the perceived exploitation of the West at the hands of eastern interests fueled booster-like attempts to build self-sufficient indigenous local industr Thus regionalism helped align Stanford s interests with those of the area s high-tech firms for the first fifty years of Silicon Valley s developmen The distinctive regional ethos of the West during the first half of the 20th century is an ingredient of Silicon Valley s already prepared environment an ingredient that would-be replicators ignore at their peri During the 1940s and 1950s Frederick Terman as dean of engineering and provost encouraged faculty and graduates to start their own companie He is credited with nurturing Hewlett-Packard Varian Associates and other high-tech firms until what would become Silicon Valley grew up around the Stanford campu Terman is often called the father of Silicon Valle Terman encouraged William Shockley co-inventor of the transistor to return to his hometown of Palo Alt In 1956 he established the Shockley Transistor Laborator The spark that set off the explosive boom of Silicon startups in Stanford Industrial Park was a personal dispute in 1957 between employees of Shockley Semiconductor and the company s namesake and founder Nobel laureate and co-inventor of the transistor William Shockley. His employees formed Fairchild Semiconductor immediately following their departure. After several years Fairchild gained its footing becoming a formidable presence in this secto Its founders began to leave to start companies based on their own latest ideas and were followed on this path by their own former leading employees. The process gained momentum and what had once began in a Stanford s research park became a veritable startup avalanche. Thus over the course of just 20 years a mere eight of Shockley s former employees gave forth 65 new enterprises which then went on to do the same. Physics In 1962-70 negotiations took place between the Cambridge Electron Accelerator Laboratory shared by Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center and the US Atomic Energy Commission over the proposed 1970 construction of the Stanford Positron Electron Asymmetric Ring SPEAR It would be the first US electron-positron colliding beam storage rin Paris 2001 explores the competition and cooperation between the two university laboratories and presents diagrams of the proposed facilities charts detailing location factors and the parameters of different project proposals between 1967 and 197 Several rings were built in Europe during the five years that it took to obtain funding for the project but the extensive project revisions resulted in a superior design that was quickly constructed and paved the way for Nobel Prizes in 1976 for Burton Richter and in 1995 for Martin Perl During 1955-85 solid state technology research and development at Stanford University followed three waves of industrial innovation made possible by support from private corporations mainly Bell Telephone Laboratories Shockley Semiconductor Fairchild Semiconductor and Xerox PAR In 1969 the Stanford Research Institute operated one of the four original nodes that comprised ARPANET predecessor to the Internet Recent history Since 2000 Stanford has expanded dramaticall In February 2012 Stanford announced the conclusion of the Stanford Challeng In a period of five years Stanford raised $6.2 billion dollars exceeding its initial goal by $2 billion making it the most successful university fundraising campaign in histor The funds will go towards 103 new endowed faculty appointments 360 graduate student research fellowships scholarships and financial aid and the construction or renovation of 38 campus building It enabled the construction of the world s largest facility dedicated exclusively to stem cell research an entirely new campus for the business school added dramatically to the law school a brand-new engineering quad created a new art and art history building an on-campus concert hall a new art museum and a planned expansion of the medical school among other In 2012 Stanford opened the Stanford Center at Peking University a just-under 400,000-square-foot three-story research center at the heart of Peking University consistently ranked as the best university in Chin The ceremony featured remarks by U.

as one of the most beautiful college campuses in the worl History of campus development An aerial photograph of the Stanford University campus in 2008 In the summer of 1886 when the campus was first being planned Stanford brought the president of Massachusetts Institute of Technology MIT Francis Amasa Walker and prominent Boston landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted westward for consultation Olmsted worked out the general concept for the campus and its buildings rejecting a hillside site in favor of the more practical flatland Charles Allerton Coolidge then developed this concept in the style of his late mentor Henry Hobson Richardson in the Richardsonian Romanesque style characterized by rectangular stone buildings linked by arcades of half-circle arche The original campus was also designed in the Spanish-colonial style common to California known as Mission Revival The red tile roofs and solid sandstone masonry are distinctly Californian in appearance and famously complementary to the bright blue skies common to the region and most of the subsequently erected buildings have maintained consistent exterior Much of this first construction was destroyed by the 1906 San Francisco earthquake but the university retains the Quad the old Chemistry Building which is not in use and has been boarded up since the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and Encina Hall the residence of Herbert Hoover John Steinbeck and Anthony Kennedy during their times at Stanford After the 1989 earthquake inflicted further damage the university implemented a billion-dollar capital improvement plan to retrofit and renovate older buildings for new up-to-date use Landmarks Stanford Main Quad at night Contemporary campus landmarks include the Main Quad and Memorial Church the Cantor Center for Visual
