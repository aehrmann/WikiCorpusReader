on tracking information of users of its Alexa Toolbar for Internet Explorer and Firefox and from their extension for Chrome Therefore the webpages viewed are only ranked amongst users who have these sidebars installed and may be biased if a specific audience subgroup is reluctant to do thi Also the ranking is based on three-month data and thus takes a long time to reflect changes in content that may happen after the domain has been sol Furthermore low rankings cannot be accurate not merely due to the paucity of data but also because of statistical laws related to the long tail distribution
