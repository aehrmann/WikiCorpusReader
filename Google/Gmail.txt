JavaScrip This caused the failure of some third-party extension On December 12 2008 Gmail added support for faster PDF viewing within the browse Criticism Privacy Google automatically scans emails to add context-sensitive advertisements to the Privacy advocates raised concerns that the plan involved scanning their personal private emails and that this was a security proble Allowing email content to be read even by a computer raises the risk that the expectation of privacy in email will be reduce Furthermore email that non-subscribers choose to send to Gmail accounts is scanned by Gmail as well even though those senders never agreed to Gmail s terms of service or privacy policy Google can change its privacy policy unilaterally and Google is technically able to cross-reference cookies across its information-rich product line to make dossiers on individual However most email systems make use of server-side content scanning in order to check for spam In 2004 privacy advocates also regard the lack of disclosed data retention and correlation policies as problemati Google has the ability to combine information contained in a person s email messages with information from Internet searche Google has not confirmed how long such information is kept or how it can be use One of the concerns is that it could be of interest to law enforcement agencie More than 30 privacy and civil liberties organizations have urged Google to suspend Gmail service until these issues are resolve Gmail s privacy policy used to contain the clause residual copies of deleted messages and accounts may take up to 60 days to be deleted from our active servers and may remain in our offline backup systems However this statement does not appear in Gmail s current privacy polic Less specifically Google have stated that they will make reasonable efforts to remove deleted information from our systems as quickly as is practica Google defends its position by citing their use of email-scanning to the user s benefi Google states that Gmail refrains from displaying ads next to potentially sensitive messages such as those that mention tragedy catastrophe or deat Gmail accounts of human rights activists in China were hacked in sophisticated attacks thought to use phishing and exploit a vulnerability in Internet Explorer in late 200 Any web mail or other mail system which stores and retains user s email contents is an attractive target for such attacks but Gmail is popular with security-conscious users because of its early HTTPS secure encrypted connection support and its more-recent HTTPS-only default settin The launch of Google Buzz as an opt-out social network immediately drew criticism for violating user privacy because it automatically allowed Gmail users contacts to view their other contact Buzz was discontinued in December 201 In July 2012 Some California residents filed a lawsuit against Google and Yahoo! claiming that they illegally intercept emails sent by individual non-Gmail and non-subscribers to Gmail and Yahoo subscribers without their knowledge consent or permissio Technical limitations Gmail does not allow users to send or receive executable files or archives containing executable files if it recognizes the file extension as one used for executable files or archive By design Gmail does not deliver all of a user s email When downloading mail through POP or IMAP access Gmail fails to deliver messages that users have sent to themselves if the client has a copy of it alread It also does not deliver to a user s inbox via any access interface those messages that users have sent to mailing lists and which they might expect to receive back via the mailing lis Before September 29 2010 Gmail sorted email only by conversations threads which can be a problem for large conversation For example if a user sends a query to a large group of people all of the responses are stored in a single conversation that is impossible to break apar There is no way to search for responses from one user without getting the entire conversatio While deletion of individual emails is possible most operations such as archiving and labeling can be performed only on whole conversation Conversations cannot be split up or combine As a result of complaints from some users Google made conversation view optional starting September 29 201 Outages

exposing the Gmail address Google claimed that this would help prevent mail from being marked as spam A number of Gmail users complained that this implementation was both a privacy concern and a professionalism proble On July 30 2009 Gmail announced an update to resolve this issu The updated custom From feature allows users to send messages from Gmail using a custom SMTP server instead of
