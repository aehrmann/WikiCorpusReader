in the year 1885-86 alon The prevailing tendency is for the municipalities to absorb also the tramway industry 31 localities already owning their own lines comprising a quarter of the mileage in the

discussion on the talk page November 2010 Vladimir Lenin was sharply critical of municipal socialism when the idea was taken up by Russian Mensheviks in the early twentieth century The bourgeois intelligentsia of the West like the English Fabians elevate municipal socialism to a special trend precisely because it dreams of social peace of class conciliation and seeks to divert public attention away from the fundamental questions of the economic system as a whole and of the state structure as a whole to minor questions of local self-governmen In the sphere of questions in the first category the class antagonisms stand out most sharply that is the sphere which as we have shown affects the very foundations of the class rule of the bourgeoisi Hence it is in that sphere that the philistine reactionary utopia of bringing about socialism piecemeal is particularly hopeles The Marxist left was also critical of its 1980s incarnatio For example the Revolutionary Communist Group has argued that Municipal socialism became an avenue that Labour used to retain the allegiance of the new labour aristocracy from the public sector Many jobs and non-jobs were given to this already privileged layer as the left feathered its own nes Spurious community groups housing schemes race relations and ethnic minority units for tiny privileged layers of black and Irish people were set up and paid fo They were all designed to foster the interests of those who found jobs and funding through them with little benefit to those who were really suffering the onslaught of Thatcherism Even when municipal socialism took on a popular and widely supported position its limitations were quickly expose The Fare s Fair dispute of 1982 showed this at an early stage after the Law Lords overruled an attempt to introduce cheap fares on London transport and Ken Livingstone s Greater London Council did not make a serious fight of i In reality Thatcher destroyed municipal socialism by continually
