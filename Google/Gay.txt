The poster on the wall is for La Traviata an opera about a courtesa The word gay arrived in English during the 12th century from Old French gai most likely deriving ultimately from a Germanic sourc For most of its life in English the word s primary meaning was joyful carefree bright and showy and the word was very commonly used with this meaning in speech and literatur For example the optimistic 1890s are still often referred to as the Gay Nineties The title of the 1938 French ballet Gat Parisienne Parisian Gaiety which became the 1941 Warner Brothers movie The Gay Parisian also illustrates this connotatio It was apparently not until the 20th century that the word began to be used to mean specifically homosexual although it had earlier acquired sexual connotation The derived abstract noun gaiety remains largely free of sexual connotations and has in the past been used in the names of places of entertainment for example W. Yeats heard Oscar Wilde lecture at the Gaiety Theatre in Dubli Sexualization Usage statistics from English books according to Google Ngram Viewer The word had started to acquire associations of immorality by 1637 and was used in the late 17th century with the meaning addicted to pleasures and dissipation This was by extension from the primary meaning of carefree implying uninhibited by moral constraint A gay woman was a prostitute a gay man a womanizer and a gay house a brothel The use of gay to mean homosexual was in origin merely an extension of the word s sexualised connotation of carefree and uninhibited which implied a willingness to disregard conventional or respectable sexual more Such usage is documented as early as the 1920s and there is evidence for it before the 20th century although it was initially more commonly used to imply heterosexually unconstrained lifestyles as in the once-common phrase gay Lothario or in the title of the book and film The Gay Falcon 1941 which concerns a womanizing detective whose first name is Ga Well into the mid 20th century a middle-aged bachelor could be described as gay indicating that he was unattached and therefore free without any implication of homosexualit This usage could apply to women to The British comic strip Jane was first published in the 1930s and described the adventures of Jane Gay Far from implying homosexuality it referred to her free-wheeling lifestyle with plenty of boyfriends while also punning on Lady Jane Grey A passage from Gertrude Stein s Miss Furr Miss Skeene 1922 is possibly the first traceable published use of the word to refer to a homosexual relationshi According to Linda Wagner-Martin Favored Strangers Gertrude Stein and her Family 1995 the portrait featured the sly repetition of the word gay used with sexual intent for one of the first times in linguistic history and Edmund Wilson 1951 quoted by James Mellow in Charmed Circle 1974 agree For example They were ..gay they learned little things that are things in being gay,. they were quite regularly ga Gertrude Stein 1922 Through the mid 20th century the term gay commonly referred to carefree as illustrated in the Astaire and Rogers film The Gay Divorcee [ citation needed ] Bringing Up Baby 1938 was the first film to use the word gay in apparent reference to homosexualit In a scene in which the Cary Grant character s clothes have been sent to the cleaners he is forced to wear a womans feather-trimmed rob When another character asks about his robe he responds Because I just went gay...all of a sudden! Since this was a mainstream film at a time when the use of the word to refer to homosexuality would still be unfamiliar to most film-goers the line can also be interpreted to mean I just decided to do something frivolou [ citation needed ] The word continued to be used with the dominant meaning of carefree as evidenced by the title of The Gay Divorcee 1934 a musical film about a heterosexual coupl Shift to homosexual By the mid-20th century gay was well established in reference to hedonistic and uninhibited lifestyles and its antonym straight which had long had connotations of seriousness respectability and conventionality had now acquired specific connotations of heterosexualit In the case of gay other connotations of frivolousness and showiness in dress gay apparel led to association with camp and effeminacy This association no doubt helped the gradual narrowing in scope of the term towards its current dominant meaning which was at first confined to subculture Gay was the preferred term since other terms such as queer were felt to be derogator Homosexual is perceived as excessively clinical since the sexual orientation now commonly referred to as homosexuality was at that time a mental illness diagnosis in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders DSM In mid-20th century Britain where male homosexuality was illegal until the Sexual Offences Act 1967 to openly identify someone as homosexual was considered very offensive and an accusation of serious criminal activit Additionally none of the words describing any aspect of homosexuality were considered suitable for polite societ Consequently a number of euphemisms were used to hint at suspected homosexualit Examples include sporty girls and artistic boys all with the stress deliberately on the otherwise completely innocent adjectiv The sixties marked the transition in the predominant meaning of the word gay from that of carefree to the current homosexual By 1963 a new sense of the word gay was known well enough to be used by Albert Ellis in his book The Intelligent Woman s Guide to Man-Hunting Similarly Hubert Selby J in his 1964 novel Last Exit to Brooklyn could write [he] took pride in being a homosexual by feeling intellectually and esthetically superior to those especially women who weren t gay. Later examples of the original meaning of the word being used in popular culture include the theme song to the 19601966 animated TV series The Flintstones whereby viewers are assured that they will have a gay old tim Similarly the 1966 Herman s Hermits song No Milk Today which became a Top 10 hit in the UK and a Top 40 hit in the U. and included the lyric No milk today it was not always so The

Savage s The Kinks The Official Biography because the song took its name from a homosexual promoter they d encountered who d had romantic designs on songwriter Ray Davies teenage brother and the lines

within what was then called the gay community to add the term lesbian to the name of all gay organizations that catered to both male and female homosexuals and to use the terminology of gay and lesbian or lesbian/gay when referring to that communit So organizations like the National Gay Task Force became the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force For many ardent feminist lesbians it was also important that the L come first lest an L following a G become another symbol of male dominance over women although other women prefer the usage gay woman In the 1990s this was followed by another equally concerted push to include the terminology specifically pointing out the inclusion of bisexual transgender intersex and other people reflecting the intra-community debate as to whether these other sexual minorities were part of the same human rights movemen Most news organizations have formally adopted variations of this use following the example and preference of the organizations as reflected in their press releases and public communication Some still disregard those developments and just use gay or gay community as synonyms for LGBT community It causes offence and possibly harm to those of the minorities whose issues are not male or of sexual orientation and may be heterosexual to be erased in that manne Proper usage would be when the speaker is referring only to homosexual

insult became common among young peopl This usage of the word has been criticized as homophobic A 2006 BBC ruling by the Board of Governors over the use of the word in this context by Chris Moyles on his Radio 1 show I do not want that one it s gay advises caution on its use for this reason The word gay in addition to being used to mean homosexual or carefree was often now used to mean lame or rubbis This is a widespread current usage of the word amongst young people. The word gay need not be offensive. or homophobic The governors said however that Moyles was simply keeping up with developments in English usag The committee. was familiar with hearing this word in this contex The governors believed that in describing a ring tone as gay the DJ was conveying that he thought it was rubbish rather than homosexual The panel acknowledged however that this use. in a derogatory sense. could cause offence in some listeners and counselled caution on its us BBC Board of Governors The BBC s ruling was heavily criticised by the Minister for Children Kevin Brennan who stated in response that the casual use of homophobic language by mainstream radio DJs is too often seen as harmless banter instead of the offensive insult that it really represent To ignore this problem is to collude in i The blind eye to casual name-calling looking the other way because it is the easy option is simply intolerabl Tony Grew Shortly after the Moyles incident a campaign against homophobia was launched in Britain under the slogan homophobia is gay playing on the double meaning of the word gay in youth cultur Parallels in other languages The concept of a gay identity and the use of the term gay may not be used or understood the same way in non-Westernised cultures since modes of sexuality may differ from those prevalent in the Wes The German equivalent for gay schwul which is etymologically derived from schwuel hot humid also acquired the pejorative meaning within youth cultur The Spanish language usually employ the term homosexual to describe gay people and the community but also use the English word gay The Spanish pejorative slang terms for a gay male maricn and joto derive in the former case from the name Maria in the latter from associations with dances of similar name The Spanish slang for a lesbian manflor appears to derive from an association with a masculinized flowe See also LGBT portal Anti-LGBT slogans Deviance sociology Gay bashing Gender identity Gender identity disorder Hate speech Heterosexism Human male sexuality Human Rights Campaign Labeling theory LGBT rights opposition LGBT themes in mythology List of gay lesbian or bisexual people National Gay and Lesbian Task Force Religion and sexuality Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures Stigma Notes a b c d e f g Online Etymology Dictionary GLAAD Media Reference Guide - Offensive Terms To Avoid 2012-04-21 APA Style Guide Avoiding Heterosexual Bias in Language Sherwin Adam 6 June 2006 BBC ruling on use of the word gay The Times London Retrieved 3 May 2010 Anti-gay abuse seen to pervade U. schools Archived from the original on 2007-03-01 The Great Social Evil Retrieved September 5 2012 Punch magazine Volume 33 1857 page 39 A stand-alone editorial cartoon no accompanying articl The Gay Parisian 1941 - IMDb Publications Oscar Wilde Societ 1 November 2008 Retrieved 4 August 2009 Oxford English Dictionary entry for Ga Bartleby dictionary Martha Stone SeptOct 200 Who were Miss Furr and Miss Skeene?
