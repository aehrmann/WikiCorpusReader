Pontchartrain on-the-Strait on the strait known as the Detroit River between lakes Saint Clair and Erie Cadillac had convinced King Louis XIV s chief minister Louis Phlypeaux Comte de Pontchartrain that a permanent community there would strengthen French control over the upper Great Lakes and discourage British aspiration The hundred soldiers and workers who accompanied Cadillac built a fort enclosing one arpent about 0.85 acres 3,400m 2 the equivalent of just under 200 feet 61m per side and named it Fort Pontchartrain Cadillac s wife Marie Thrse Guyon soon moved to Detroit becoming one
