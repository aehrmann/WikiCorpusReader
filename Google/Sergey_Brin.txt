and Internet entrepreneur who with Larry Page co-founded Google one of the most profitable Internet companie As of 2012 [update] his personal wealth is estimated to be $20.3 billion Together Brin and Page own about 16 percent of the compan Brin immigrated to the United States from the Soviet Union at the age of si He earned his undergraduate degree at the University of Maryland following in his father s and grandfather s footsteps by studying mathematics as well as computer science After graduation he moved to Stanford University to acquire a Ph. in computer scienc There he met Larry Page with whom he later became friend They crammed their dormitory room with inexpensive computers and applied Brin s data mining system to build a superior search engine The program became popular at Stanford and they suspended their PhD studies to start up Google in a rented garag The Economist magazine referred to Brin as an Enlightenment Man and someone who believes that knowledge is always good and certainly always better than ignorance a philosophy that is summed up by Googles motto Organize the worlds information and make it universally accessible and useful and Don t be evil 1 Early life and education 1.1 Childhood in the Soviet Union 1.2 Education in the United States 2 Search engine development 3 Personal life 4 Censorship of Google in China 5 Awards and recognition 6 Other interests 7 References 8 External links Early life and education Brin was born in Moscow to Russian Jewish parents Michael Brin and Eugenia Brin both graduates of Moscow State University His father is a mathematics professor at the University of Maryland and his mother a researcher at NASA s Goddard Space Flight Center Childhood in the Soviet Union In 1979 when Brin was six his family felt compelled to immigrate to the United State In an interview with Mark Malseed co-author of The Google Story Sergey s father explains how he was forced to abandon his dream of becoming an astronomer even before he reached college Although an official policy of anti-Semitism did not exist in the Soviet Union Michael Brin claims Communist Party heads barred Jews from upper professional ranks by denying them entry to universities as Jews were excluded from the physics departments in particula Michael Brin therefore changed his major to mathematics where he received nearly straight A He said Nobody would even consider me for graduate school because I was Jewis At Moscow State University Jews were required to take their entrance exams in different rooms from non-Jewish applicants which were nicknamed gas chambers and they were marked on a harsher scal The Brin family lived in a three-room apartment in central Moscow which they also shared with Sergey s paternal grandmothe Sergey told Malseed I ve known for a long time that my father wasn t able to pursue the career he wanted but Sergey only picked up the details years later after they had settled in the United State He learned that in 1977 after his father returned from a mathematics conference in Warsaw Poland he announced that it was time for the family to emigrat We cannot stay here any more he told his wife and mothe At the conference he was able to mingle freely with colleagues from the United States France England and Germany and discovered that his intellectual brethren in the West were not monster He added I was the only one in the family who decided it was really important to leav Sergey s mother was less willing to leave their home in Moscow where they had spent their entire live Malseed writes For Genia the decision ultimately came down to Serge While her husband admits he was thinking as much about his own future as his son s for her it was 80/20 about Serge They formally applied for their exit visa in September 1978 and as a result his father was promptly fired For related reasons his mother also had to leave her jo For the next eight months without any steady income they were forced to take on temporary jobs as they waited afraid their request would be denied as it was for many refuseniks During this time his parents shared responsibility for looking after him and his father taught himself computer programming In May 1979 they were granted their official exit visas and were allowed to leave the countr At an interview in October 2000 Brin said I know the hard times that my parents went through there and am very thankful that I was brought to the State In the summer of 1990 a few weeks before his 17th birthday his father led a group of high school math students including Sergey on a two-week exchange program to the Soviet Unio As Sergey recalls the trip awakened his childhood fear of authority and he remembered that his first impulse on confronting Soviet oppression had been to throw pebbles at a police car Malseed adds On the second day of the trip while the group toured a sanitarium in the countryside near Moscow Sergey took his father aside looked him in the eye and said Thank you for taking us all out of Russi Education in the United States Brin attended grade school at Paint Branch Montessori School in Adelphi Maryland but he received further education at home his father a professor in the department of mathematics at the University of Maryland encouraged him to learn mathematics and his family helped him retain his Russian-language skill In September 1990 Brin enrolled in the University of Maryland to study computer science and mathematics where he received his Bachelor of Science in May 1993 with honor Brin began his graduate study in computer science at Stanford University on a graduate fellowship from the National Science Foundation In 1993 he interned at Wolfram Research who were the developers of Mathematica As of 2008 he is on leave from his Ph. studies at Stanfor Search engine development During an orientation for new students at Stanford he met Larry Pag In a recent interview for The Economist Brin jokingly said We re both kind of obnoxiou They seemed to disagree on most subject But after spending time together they became intellectual soul-mates and close friends Brin s focus was on developing data mining systems while Page s was in extending the concept of inferring the importance of a research paper from its citations in other paper Together the pair authored a paper entitled The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engin Combining their ideas they began cramming their dormitory room with cheap computers and tested their new search engine designs on the we Their project grew quickly enough to cause problems for Stanford s computing infrastructur But they realized they had succeeded in creating a superior engine for searching the web and suspended their PhD studies to work more on their syste As Mark Malseed wrote Soliciting funds from faculty members family and friends Sergey and Larry scraped together enough to buy some servers and rent that famous garage in Menlo Park [soon after] Sun Microsystems co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim wrote a $100,000 check to Google In The only problem was Google In did not yet existthe company hadnt yet been incorporate For two weeks as they handled the paperwork the young men had nowhere to deposit the mone The Economist magazine describes Brin s approach to life like Page s as based on a vision summed up by Google s motto of making all the world s information universally accessible and usefu Others have compared their vision to the impact of Johannes Gutenberg the inventor of modern printing In 1440 Johannes Gutenberg introduced Europe to the mechanical printing press printing Bibles for mass consumptio The technology allowed for books and manuscripts originally replicated by hand to be printed at a much faster rate thus spreading knowledge and helping to usher in the European Renaissance Google has done a similar jo The comparison was likewise noted by the authors of The Google Story Not since Gutenberg has any new invention empowered individuals and transformed access to information as profoundly as Googl 1 Also not long after the two cooked up their new engine for web searches they began thinking about information that is today beyond the web such as digitizing books and expanding health informatio Personal life In May 2007 Brin married Anne Wojcicki in the Bahamas Wojcicki is a biotech analyst and a 1996 graduate of Yale University with a B. in biology She has an active interest in health information and together she and Brin are developing new ways to improve access to i As part of their efforts they have brainstormed with leading researchers about the human genome project Brin instinctively regards genetics as a database and computing proble So does his wife who co-founded the firm 23andMe which lets people analyze and compare their own genetic makeup consisting of 23 pairs of chromosomes Brin s mother Eugenia has been diagnosed with Parkinson s disease In 2008 he decided to make a donation to the University of Maryland School of Medicine where his mother is being treate Brin used the services of 23andMe and discovered that although Parkinson s is generally not hereditary both he and his mother possess a mutation of the LRRK2 gene G2019S that puts the likelihood of his developing Parkinson s in later years between 20 and 80 When asked whether ignorance was not bliss in such matters he stated that his knowledge means that he can now take measures to ward off the diseas An editorial in The Economist magazine states that Mr Brin regards his mutation of LRRK2 as a bug in his personal code and thus as no different from the bugs in computer code that Googles engineers fix every da By helping himself he can therefore help others as wel He considers himself luck But M Brin was making a much bigger poin Isnt knowledge always good and certainty always better than ignorance? Brin and his wife run The Brin Wojcicki Foundatio In September 2012 at the signing of the California Driveless Vehicle Bill he claimed that in five years robotic cars will be available to the general public within five year Censorship of Google in China For more details on this topic see Censorship in the People s Republic of China Remembering his youth and his family s reasons for leaving the Soviet Union he agonized over Googles decision to appease the communist government of China by allowing it to censor search engine results but he decided that the Chinese would still be better off than without having Google availabl On January 12 2010 Google reported a large cyber attack on its computers and corporate infrastructure that began a month earlier which included accessing two Gmail accounts and the theft of Google s intellectual propert After the attack was determined to have originated in China the company stated that it would no longer agree to censor its search engine in China and may exit the country altogethe David Drummond Google s Senior Vice President of Corporate Development reported that a primary goal of the attackers was accessing the Gmail accounts of Chinese human rights activists but that the attack also targeted 20 other large companies in the finance technology media and chemical sector It was later reported that the attack included one of Googles crown jewels a password system that controls access by millions of users worldwid In late March 2010 it officially discontinued its China-based search engine while keeping its uncensored Hong Kong site in operatio Speaking for Google Brin stated during an interview One of the reasons I am glad we are making this move in China is that the China situation was really emboldening other countries to try and implement their own firewall During another interview with Spiegel he added For us it has always been a discussion about how we can best fight for openness on the Interne We believe that this is the best thing that we can do for preserving the principles of the openness and freedom of information on the Interne Senator Byron Dorgan stated that Google s decision is a strong step in favor of freedom of expression and informatio And Congressman Bob Goodlatte said I applaud Google for its courageous step to stop censoring search results on Google.co Google has drawn a line in the sand and is shining a light on the very dark area of individual liberty restrictions in Chin From the business perspective many recognize that the move is likely to affect Google s profit The New Republic adds that Google seems to have arrived at the same link that was obvious to Andrei Sakharov the one between science and freedom referring to the move as herois Awards and recognition In 2002 Brin along with Larry Page was named to the MIT Technology Review TR100 as one of the top 100 innovators in the world under the age of 3 In 2003 both Brin and Page received an honorary MBA from IE Business School for embodying the entrepreneurial spirit and lending momentum to the creation of new businesses. In 2004 they received the Marconi Foundation Prize the Highest Award in Engineering and were elected Fellows of the Marconi Foundation at Columbia University In announcing their selection John Jay Iselin the Foundation s president congratulated the two men for their invention that has fundamentally changed the way information is retrieved toda In 2004 Brin received the Academy of Achievement s Golden Plate Award with Larry Page at a ceremony in Chicago Illinoi In November 2009 Forbes magazine decided Brin and Larry Page were the fifth most powerful people in the worl Earlier that same year in February Brin was inducted into the National Academy of Engineering which is among the highest professional distinctions accorded to an engineer [and] honors those who have made outstanding contributions to engineering research practice. He was selected specifically for leadership in development of rapid indexing and retrieval of relevant information from the World Wide We In their Profiles of Fellows the National Science Foundation included a number of earlier awards he was a featured speaker at the World Economic Forum and the Technology Entertainment and Design Conferenc PC Magazine has praised Google in the Top 100 Web Sites and Search Engines 1998 and awarded Google the Technical Excellence Award for Innovation in Web Application Development in 199 In 2000 Google earned a Webby Award a People s Voice Award for technical achievement and in 2001 was awarded Outstanding Search Service Best Image Search Engine Best Design Most Webmaster Friendly Search Engine and Best Search Feature at the Search Engine Watch Award According to Forbes he is the 24th richest person in the world with a personal wealth of US$18.7 billion as of March 201 Other interests Brin is working on other more personal projects that reach beyond Googl For example he and Page are trying to help solve the worlds energy and climate problems at Googles philanthropic arm Google.org which invests in the alternative energy industry to find wider sources of renewable energy The company acknowledges that its founders want to solve really big problems using technolog In October 2010 for example they invested in a major offshore wind power development to assist the East coast power grid which will eventually become one of about a dozen offshore wind farms are proposed for the regio A week earlier they introduced a car that with artificial intelligence can drive itself using video cameras and radar sensor In the future drivers of cars with similar sensors would have fewer accident These safer vehicles could therefore be built lighter and require less fuel consumptio They are trying to get companies to create innovative solutions to increasing the world s energy suppl He is an investor in Tesla Motors which has developed the Tesla Roadster a 244-mile 393km range battery electric vehicle In 2004 he and Larry Page were named Persons of the Week by ABC World News Tonight In January 2005 he was nominated to be one of the World Economic Forum s Young Global Leaders He and Page are also the executive producers of the 2007 film Broken Arrows In June 2008 Brin invested $4.5 million in Space Adventures the Virginia -based space tourism compan His investment will serve as a deposit for a reservation on one of Space Adventures proposed flights in 201 Space Adventures the only company that sends tourists to space has sent five of them so fa He and Page co-own a customized Boeing 767200 and a Dornier Alpha Jet and pay $1.3 million a year to house them and two Gulfstream V jets owned by Google executives at Moffett Federal Airfield The aircraft have had scientific equipment installed by NASA to allow experimental data to be collected in fligh In 2012 Brin has been involved with the Project Glass program and has demoed eyeglass prototype Project Glass is a research and development program by Google to develop an augmented reality head-mounted display HMD The intended purpose of Project Glass products would be the hands-free displaying of information currently available to most smartphone users and allowing for interaction with the Internet via natural language voice command References a b Sergey Brin NNDB Retrieved January 7 201 a b c Sergey Brin Forbes Retrieved February 2011 a b Argetsinger Amy Roberts Roxanne May 13 2007 Amy Argetsinger and Roxanne Roberts Oprah Winfrey s Degrees of Communication at Howard The Washington Post Retrieved October 20 2007 Daily Market Beat Trinity Investment Research Retrieved August 18 2011 Google s Misson Google a b c d e f g h Enlightenment Man The Economist Dec 6 2008 Dominic Lawson More migrants please especially the clever ones The Independent U.K. October 11 2011 a b c d e f g Malseed Mark February 2007 The Story of Sergey Brin Moment Magazine Retrieved January 7 201 Smale Will April 30 2004 Profile The Google founders BBC New Retrieved January 7 201 a b Vise David and Malseed Mar The Google Story Delta Pub 2006 Dominic Lawson More migrants please especially the clever ones The Independent London October 11 2011 Scott Virgini Google Corporations That Changed the World Greenwood Publishing Group 2008 a b Brin Sergey January 7 1997 Resume Retrieved March 9 2008 Sergey Brin Executive Profile Biography BusinessWeek Business Week Retrieved March 9 2008 He is currently on leave from the PhD program in computer science at Stanford university.
