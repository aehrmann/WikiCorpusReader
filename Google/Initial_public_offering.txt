or stock market launch is a type of public offering where shares of stock in a company are sold to the general public on a securities exchange for the first tim Through this process a private company transforms into a public company Initial public offerings are used by companies to raise expansion capital to possibly monetize the investments of early private investors and to become publicly traded enterprise A company selling shares is never required to repay the capital to its public investor After the IPO when shares trade freely in the open market money passes between public investor Although an IPO offers many advantages there are also significant disadvantage Chief among these are the costs associated with the process and the requirement to disclose certain information that could prove helpful to competitors or create difficulties with vendor Details of the proposed offering are disclosed to potential purchasers in the form of a lengthy document known as a prospectus Most companies undertaking an IPO do so with the assistance of an investment banking firm acting in the capacity of an underwriter Underwriters provide a valuable service which includes help with correctly assessing the value of shares share price and establishing a public market for shares initial sale Alternative methods such as the dutch auction have also been explore In terms of size and public participation the most notable example of this method is the Google IP China has recently emerged as a major IPO market with several of the largest IPO s taking place in that countr 1 History 2

modern joint-stock companies the publicani were legal bodies independent of their members whose ownership was divided into shares or partes There is evidence that these shares were sold to public investors and traded in a type of over-the-counter market in the Forum near the Temple of Castor and Pollux The shares fluctuated in value encouraging the activity of speculators or quaestors No evidence remains of the prices for which partes were sold the nature of initial public offerings or a description of stock market behavio Publicanis lost favor with the fall of the Republic and the rise of the Empir In March 1602 the Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie VOC or Dutch East India Company was forme The VOC was the first modern company to issue public shares and it is this issuance at the beginning of the 16th century that is considered the first modern IP The company had an original paid-up share capital of 6,424,588 guilder The ability to raise this large sum is attributable to the decision taken by the owners to open up access to share ownership to a wide publi Everyone living in the United Provinces had an opportunity to participate in the Compan Each share was worth 3000 guilders roughly equivalent to US$1,500 All the shares were tradable and the shareholders received receipts for the purchas A share certificate documenting payment and ownership such as we know today was not issued but ownership was instead entered in the companys share registe In the United States the first IPO was the public offering of Bank of North America Reasons for listing When a company lists its securities on a public exchange the money paid by the investing public for the newly issued shares goes directly to the company primary offering as well as to any early private investors who opt to sell all or a portion of their holdings secondary offering as part of the larger IP An IPO therefore allows a company to tap into a wide pool of potential investors to provide itself with capital for future growth repayment of debt or working capita A company selling common shares is never required to repay the capital to its public investor Those investors must endure the unpredictable nature of the open market to price and trade their share After the IPO when shares trade freely in the open market money passes between public investor For early private investors who choose to sell shares as part of the IPO process the IPO represents an opportunity to monetize their investmen After the IPO once shares trade in the open market investors holding large blocks of shares can either sell those shares piecemeal in the open market or sell a large block of shares directly to the public at a fixed price through a secondary market offering This type of offering is not dilutive since no new shares are being create Once a company is listed it is able to issue additional common shares in a number of different ways one of which is the follow-on offering This method provides capital for various corporate purposes through the issuance of equity see stock dilution without incurring any deb This ability to quickly raise potentially large amounts of capital from the marketplace is a key reason many companies seek to go publi An IPO accords several benefits to the previously private company Enlarging and diversifying equity base Enabling cheaper access to capital Increasing exposure prestige and public image Attracting and retaining better management and employees through liquid equity participation Facilitating acquisitions potentially in return for shares of stock Creating multiple financing opportunities equity convertible debt cheaper bank loans et Advance Planning Careful advance planning is crucial to a successful IP One book suggests the following 7 advance planning steps 1 develop an impressive management and professional team 2 grow the company s business with an eye to the public marketplace 3 obtain audited or auditable financial statements using IPO-accepted accounting principles 4 clean up the company s act 5 establish antitakeover defenses 6 develop good corporate governance 7 create insider bail-out opportunities and take advantage of IPO window Disadvantages of an IPO There are several disadvantages to completing an initial public offering Significant legal accounting and marketing costs many of which are ongoing Requirement to disclose financial and business information Meaningful time effort and attention required of senior management Risk that required funding will not be raised Public dissemination of information which may be useful to competitors suppliers and customer Procedure IPOs generally involve one or more investment banks known as underwriters The company offering its shares called the issuer enters into a contract with a lead underwriter to sell its shares to the publi The underwriter then approaches investors with offers to sell those share The sale allocation and pricing of shares in an IPO may take several form Common methods include Best efforts contract Firm commitment contract All-or-none contract Bought deal A large IPO is usually underwritten by a syndicate of investment banks the largest of which take the position of lead underwriter Upon selling the shares the underwriters retain a portion of the proceeds as their fe This fee is called an underwriting spread The spread is calculated as a discount from the price of the shares sold called the gross spread Components of an underwriting spread in an initial public offering IPO typically include the following on a per share basis Manager s fee Underwriting feeearned by members of the syndicate and the Concessionearned by the broker-dealer selling the share The Manager would be entitled to the entire underwriting sprea A member of the syndicate is entitled to the underwriting fee and the concessio A broker dealer who is not a member of the syndicate but sells shares would receive only the concession while the member of the syndicate who provided the shares to that broker dealer would retain the underwriting fe Usually the managing/lead underwriter also known as the bookrunner typically the underwriter selling the largest proportions of the IPO takes the highest portion of the gross spread up to 8% in some case Multinational IPOs may have many syndicates to deal with differing legal requirements in both the issuer s domestic market and other region For example an issuer based in the E. may be represented by the main selling syndicate in its domestic market Europe in addition to separate syndicates or selling groups for US/Canada and for Asi Usually the lead underwriter in the main selling group is also the lead bank in the other selling group Because of the wide array of legal requirements and because it is an expensive process IPOs typically involve one or more law firms with major practices in securities law such as the Magic Circle firms of London and the white shoe firms of New York Cit Public offerings are sold to both institutional investors and retail clients of the underwriter A licensed securities salesperson Registered Representative in the USA and Canada selling shares of a public offering to his clients is paid a portion of the selling concession the fee paid by the issuer to the underwriter rather than by his clien In some situations when the IPO is not a hot issue undersubscribed and where the salesperson is the client s advisor it is possible that the financial incentives of the advisor and client may not be aligne The issuer usually allows the underwriters an option to increase the size of the offering by up to 15% under certain circumstance known as the greenshoe or overallotment optio This option is always exercised when the offering is considered a hot issue by virtue of being oversubscribe In the USA clients are given a preliminary prospectus known as a red herring prospectus during the initial quiet perio The red herring prospectus is so named because of a bold red warning statement printed on its front cove The warning states that the offering information is incomplete and may be change The actual wording can vary although most roughly follow the format exhibited on the Facebook IPO red herrin During the quiet period the shares cannot be offered for sal Brokers can however take indications of interest from their client At the time of the stock launch after the Registration Statement has become effective indications of interest can be converted to buy orders at the discretion of the buye Sales can only be made through a final prospectus cleared by the Securities and Exchange Commissio Before legal actions initiated by New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer which later became known as the Global Settlement enforcement agreement some large investment firms had initiated favorable research coverage of companies in an effort to aid Corporate Finance departments and retail divisions engaged in the marketing of new issue The central issue in that enforcement agreement had been judged in court previousl It involved the conflict of interest between the investment banking and analysis departments of ten of the largest investment firms in the United State The investment firms involved in the settlement had all engaged in actions and practices that had allowed the inappropriate influence of their research analysts by their investment bankers seeking lucrative fee A typical violation addressed by the settlement was the case of CSFB and Salomon Smith Barney which were alleged to have engaged in inappropriate spinning of hot IPOs and issued fraudulent research reports in violation of various sections within the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Dutch Auction A Dutch Auction allows shares of an initial public offering to be allocated based only on price aggressiveness with all successful bidders paying the same price per shar One version of the Dutch auction is OpenIPO which is based on an auction system designed by Nobel Prize -winning economist William Vickrey This auction method ranks bids from highest to lowest then accepts the highest bids that allow all shares to be sold with all winning bidders paying the same pric It is similar to the model used to auction Treasury bills notes and bonds since the 1990 Before this Treasury bills were auctioned through a discriminatory or pay-what-you-bid auction in which the various winning bidders each paid the price or yield they bid and thus the various winning bidders did not all pay the same pric Both discriminatory and uniform price or Dutch auctions have been used for IPOs in many countries although only uniform price auctions have been used so far in the U A variation of the Dutch Auction has been used to take a number of companies public including Morningstar Interactive Brokers Group Overstock.com Ravenswood Winery Clean Energy Fuels and Boston Beer Company In 2004 Google used the Dutch Auction system for its Initial Public Offerin Traditional investment banks have shown resistance to the idea of using an auction process to engage in public securities offering The auction method allows for equal access to the allocation of shares and eliminates the favorable treatment accorded important clients by the underwriters in conventional IPO In the face of this resistance the Dutch Auction is still a little used method in public offering In determining the success or failure of a Dutch Auction one must consider competing objective If the objective is to reduce risk a traditional IPO may be more effective because the underwriter manages the process rather than leaving the outcome in part to random chance in terms of who chooses to bid or what strategy each bidder chooses to follo From the viewpoint of the investor the Dutch Auction allows everyone equal acces Moreover some forms of the Dutch Auction allow the underwriter to be more active in coordinating bids and even communicating general auction trends to some bidders during the bidding perio From the viewpoint of the investor the Dutch Auction would be more effective at price discovery and potentially result in a lower offering pric There is no evidence to indicate that the Dutch Auction fares any better than the traditional IPO in an unwelcoming market environmen A Dutch Auction IPO by WhiteGlove Health Inc. announced in May of 2011 was postponed in September of that year after several failed attempts to pric An article in the Wall Street Journal cited the reasons as Broader stock-market volatility and uncertainty about the global economy have made investors wary of investing in new stock Direct Public Offering Financial historians Richard Sylla and Robert Wright have shown that before 1860 most early U. corporations sold shares in themselves directly to the public without the aid of intermediaries like investment bank The direct public offering or DPO as they term it was not done by auction but rather at a share price set by the issuing corporatio In this sense it is the same as the fixed price public offers that were the traditional IPO method in most non-US countries in the early 1990 The DPO eliminated the agency problem associated with offerings intermediated by investment bank Pricing of IPO A company planning an IPO typically appoints a lead manager known as a bookrunner to help it arrive at an appropriate price at which the shares should be issue There are two primary ways in which the price of an IPO can be determine Either the company with the help of its lead managers fixes a price fixed price method or the price can be determined through analysis of confidential investor demand data compiled by the bookrunne That process is known as book building Historically some IPOs both globally and in the United States have been underprice The effect of initial underpricing an IPO is to generate additional interest in the stock when it first becomes publicly trade Flipping or quickly selling shares for a profit can lead to significant gains for investors who have been allocated shares of the IPO at the offering pric However underpricing an IPO results in lost potential capital for the issue One extreme example is theglobe.com IPO which helped fuel the IPO mania of the late 90 s internet er Underwritten by Bear Stearns on November 13 1998 the IPO was priced at $9 per shar The share price quickly increased 1000% after the opening of trading to a high of $9 Selling pressure from institutional flipping eventually drove the stock back down and it closed the day at $6 Although the company did raise about $30 million from the offering it is estimated that with the level of demand for the offering and the volume of trading that took place the company might have left upwards of $200 million on the tabl The danger of overpricing is also an important consideratio If a stock is offered to the public at a higher price than the market will pay the underwriters may have trouble meeting their commitments to sell share Even if they sell all of the issued shares the stock may fall in value on the first day of tradin If so the stock may lose its marketability and hence even more of its valu This could result in losses for investors many of whom being the most favored clients of the underwriter Underwriters therefore take many factors into consideration when pricing an IPO and attempt to reach an offering price that is low enough to stimulate interest in the stock but high enough to raise an adequate amount of capital for the compan The process of determining an optimal price usually involves the underwriters syndicate arranging share purchase commitments from leading institutional investor Some researchers e. Geoffrey C. and Swift 2009 believe that the underpricing of IPOs is less a deliberate act on the part of issuers and/or underwriters than the result of an over-reaction on the part of investors Friesen Swift 2009 One potential method for determining underpricing is through the use of IPO Underpricing Algorithms Quiet period Main article Quiet period There are two time windows commonly referred to as quiet periods during an IPO s histor The first and the one linked above is the period of time following the filing of the company s S-1 but before SEC staff declare the registration statement effectiv During this time issuers company insiders analysts and other parties are legally restricted in their ability to discuss or promote the upcoming IPO U. Securities and Exchange Commission 2005 The other quiet period refers to a period of 40 calendar days following an IPO s first day of public tradin During this time insiders and any underwriters involved in the IPO are restricted from issuing any earnings forecasts or research reports for the compan Regulatory changes enacted by the SEC as part of the Global Settlement enlarged the quiet period from 25 days to 40 days on July 9 200 When the quiet period is over generally the underwriters will initiate research coverage on the fir Additionally the NASDAQ and NYSE have approved a rule mandating a 10-day quiet period after a Secondary Offering and a 15-day quiet period both before and after expiration of a lock-up agreement for a securities offerin Stag profit Stag profit is a stock market term used to describe a situation before and immediately after a company s Initial public offering or any new issue of shares A stag is a party or individual who subscribes to the new issue expecting the price of the stock to rise immediately upon the start of tradin Thus stag profit is the financial gain accumulated by the party or individual resulting from the value of the shares risin This term is more popular in the United Kingdom than in the United State In the US such investors are usually called flippers because they get shares in the offering and then immediately turn around and flip or sell them on the first day of tradin Share Delivery Not all IPOs are eligible for delivery settlement through the DTC system which would then either require the physical delivery of the stock certificates to the clearing agent bank s custodian or a delivery versus payment DVP arrangement with the selling group brokerage fir Largest IPOs Agricultural Bank of China US$22.1 billion 2010 Industrial and Commercial Bank of China US$21.9 billion 2006 American International Assurance US$20.5 billion 2010 Visa In US$19.7 billion 2008 General Motors US$18.15 billion 2010 Facebook In US$16 billion 2012 Value of IPOs Prior to 2009 the United States was the leading issuer of IPOs in terms of total valu Since that time however China Shanghai Shenzhen and Hong Kong has been the leading issuer raising $73 billion almost double the amount of money raised on the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ combined up to the end of November 201 The Hong Kong Stock Exchange raised 30.9 billion in 2011 as the top course for the third year in a row while New York raised 30.7 billio See also Public offering Alternative public offering Direct public offering Equity carve-out Mergers and acquisitions MA Private placement Public offering without listing Reverse IPO Seasoned equity offering SEC Form S-1 Registration form for certain types of issuers Secondary market offering Venture capital References Edmonston Pete 2009-08-19 Google s I.P.O.
