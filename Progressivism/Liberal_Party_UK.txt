Political parties Elections The Liberal Party was one of the two major political parties of the United Kingdom during the 19th and early 20th centurie It was the third largest political party throughout the latter half of the 20th century until it merged with the Social Democratic Party SDP in 1988 to form the present day Liberal Democrats Originally supporters of Classical Liberalism the party moved towards Social Liberalism during the late 19th and early 20th centuries and came to be seen as on the centre-left of British politic It grew out of the Whig Party in 1859 and William Gladstone carried the party through governments in the late 19th centur The party split over the issue of Irish Home Rule but returned to power in 1906 through a landslide victor During this time in government the Liberals are credited with the so-called Liberal Reforms which saw the creation of a basic welfare state During World War I the Liberals governed Britain through a coalition with the Conservatives which ended in 192 In the 1920s the Labour Party permanently replaced the Liberals as Britain s main centre-left party and the Liberals went into decline which culminated in them winning as few as 6 seats at general elections during the 1950 A comeback of sorts was seen during the 1960s and 1970s but it was not until 1981 when the Liberals allied with the newly formed SDP to form the SDP-Liberal Alliance that the party enjoyed significant electoral succes In the 1983 general election the alliance took 25% of the popular vote but this only translated into 23 seats out of a total of 650 During 1988 the Liberals formally merged with the SDP to form the Liberal Democrats though a small splinter Liberal Party was formed in 1989 by former members opposed to the merge 1 Ideology 2

liberalism supporting laissez-faire economic policies such as free trade and minimal government interference in the economy this doctrine was usually termed Gladstonian Liberalism after the Victorian era Liberal Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone The Liberal Party favoured social reform personal liberty reducing the powers of the Crown and the Church of England many of them were Nonconformists and an extension of the electoral franchise Sir William Harcourt a prominent Liberal politician in the Victorian era said this about liberalism in 1872 A crowd waits outside Leeds Town Hall to see them elect a Liberal Party candidate during the 1880 general elections If there be any party which is more pledged than another to resist a policy of restrictive legislation having for its object social coercion that party is the Liberal part Cheer But liberty does not consist in making others do what you think right Hear hea The difference between a free Government and a Government which is not free is principally thisthat a Government which is not free interferes with everything it can and a free Government interferes with nothing except what it mus A despotic Government tries to make everybody do what it wishes a Liberal Government tries as far as the safety of society will permit to allow everybody to do as he wishe It has been the tradition of the Liberal party consistently to maintain the doctrine of individual libert It is because they have done so that England is the place where people can do more what they please than in any other country in the world...It is this practice of allowing one set of people to dictate to another set of people what they shall do what they shall think what they shall drink when they shall go to bed what they shall buy and where they shall buy it what wages they shall get and how they shall spend them against which the Liberal party have always proteste The political terms of modern progressive or new Liberalism began to appear in the mid to late 1880s and became increasingly common to denote the tendency in the Liberal Party to favour an increased role for the state as more important than the classical liberal stress on self-help and freedom of choic By the early 20th century the Liberals stance began to shift towards New Liberalism what would today be called social liberalism a belief in personal liberty with a support for government intervention to provide minimum levels of welfar This shift was best exemplified by the Liberal government of Herbert Henry Asquith and his Chancellor David Lloyd George whose Liberal reforms in the early 1900s created a basic welfare state David Lloyd George adopted a programme at the 1929 general election entitled We Can Conquer Unemployment! although by this stage the Liberals had declined to third-party statu The Liberals now as expressed in the Liberal Yellow Book regarded opposition to state intervention as being a characteristic of right-wing extremist After nearly becoming extinct in the 1940s and 50s the Liberal Party revived its fortunes somewhat under the leadership of Jo Grimond in the 1960s by positioning itself as a radical centrist non- socialist alternative to the Conservative and Labour Party governments of the tim Origins Viscount Palmerston The Liberal Party grew out of the Whigs which had its origins as an aristocratic faction in the reign of Charles II The Whigs were in favour of reducing the power of The Crown and increasing the power of the Parliament Although their motives in this were originally to gain more power for themselves the more idealistic Whigs gradually came to support an expansion of democracy for its own sak The great figures of reformist Whiggery were Charles James Fox died 1806 and his disciple and successor Earl Grey After decades in opposition the Whigs came to power under Grey in 1830 and carried the First Reform Act in 183 The Reform Act was the climax of Whiggery but also brought about the Whigs demis The admission of the middle classes to the franchise and to the House of Commons led eventually to the development of a systematic middle class liberalism and the end of Whiggery although for many years reforming aristocrats held senior positions in the part In the years after Grey s retirement the party was led first by Lord Melbourne a fairly traditional Whig and then by Lord John Russell the son of a Duke but a crusading radical and Lord Palmerston a renegade Irish Tory and essentially a conservative although capable of radical gesture As early as 1839 Russell had adopted the name Liberal Party but in reality the party was a loose coalition of Whigs in the House of Lords and Radicals in the Common The leading Radicals were John Bright and Richard Cobden who represented the manufacturing towns that had gained representation under the Reform Ac They favoured social reform personal liberty reducing the powers of the Crown and the Church of England many of them were Nonconformists avoidance of war and foreign alliances which were bad for business and above all free trade For a century free trade was the one cause which could unite all Liberal In 1841 the Liberals lost office to the Conservative Party under Sir Robert Peel but their period in opposition was short because the Conservatives split over the repeal of the Corn Laws a free trade issue and a faction known as the Peelites but not Peel himself who died soon after defected to the Liberal sid This allowed ministries led by Russell Palmerston and the Peelite Lord Aberdeen to hold office for most of the 1850s and 1860 The leading Peelite was William Ewart Gladstone who was a reforming Chancellor of the Exchequer in most of these government The formal foundation of the Liberal Party is traditionally traced to 1859 and the formation of Palmerston s second governmen The Whig-Radical amalgam could not become a true modern political party however while it was dominated by aristocrats and it was not until the departure of the Two Terrible Old Men Russell and Palmerston that Gladstone could become the first leader of the modern Liberal Part This was brought about by Palmerston s death in 1865 and Russell s retirement in 186 After a brief Conservative interlude during which the Second Reform Act was passed by agreement between the parties Gladstone won a huge victory at the 1868 election and formed the first Liberal governmen The establishment of the party as a national membership organisation came with the foundation of the National Liberal Federation in 187 The Gladstonian era William Gladstone For the next thirty years Gladstone and Liberalism were synonymou The Grand Old Man as he became known was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom four times and the powerful flow of his rhetoric dominated British politics even when he was out of offic His rivalry with the Conservative leader Benjamin Disraeli became legendar Gladstone was a High Church Anglican and enjoyed the company of aristocrats but he grew ever more progressive as he grew older he was as one wit put it a Tory in all but essentials Queen Victoria who had grown up as a Whig supporter under the tutelage of Melbourne became a Conservative in reaction to Gladstone s moralising Liberalis Gladstone s great achievements in office were his reforms to education land reform particularly in Ireland where he ended centuries of landlord oppression the disestablishment of the Anglican Church of Ireland through the Irish Church Act 1869 the introduction of democratic local government reform allowing the secret ballot the Ballot Act 1872 and removing electoral corruption the abolition of patronage in the civil service and the army and the Third Reform Act which greatly extended the vote to almost all adult male Gladstone s reforming tendencies were borne partly out of his visit to Lancashire during The Cotton Famine where he was impressed by working class qualitie It was during the 1860s that Gladstone became known as The People s William In foreign policy Gladstone was in general against foreign entanglements but did not resist the reality of imperialism For example he approved of the occupation of Egypt by British forces in 188 In the 1874 general election Gladstone was defeated by the Conservatives under Disraeli during a sharp recession He formally resigned as Liberal leader and was succeeded by the Marquess of Hartington but he soon changed his mind and returned to active politic He strongly disagreed with Disraeli s pro- Ottoman foreign policy and in 1880 he conducted the first outdoor mass-election campaign in Britain known as the Midlothian campaign The Liberals won a large majority in the 1880 election Hartington ceded his place and Gladstone resumed offic Among the consequences of the Third Reform Act 188485 was the giving of the vote to the Catholic peasants in Ireland and the consequent creation of an Irish Parliamentary Party led by Charles Stewart Parnell In the 1885 general election this party won the balance of power in the House of Commons and demanded Irish Home Rule as the price of support for a continued Gladstone ministr Gladstone personally supported Home Rule but a strong Liberal Unionist faction led by Joseph Chamberlain along with the last of the Whigs Hartington opposed i The result was a catastrophic split in the Liberal Party and heavy defeat in the 1886 election at the hands of Lord Salisbury There was a final weak Gladstone ministry in 1892 but it also was dependent on Irish support and failed to get Irish Home Rule through the House of Lord Gladstone finally retired in 1894 and his ineffectual successor Lord Rosebery led the party to another heavy defeat in the 1895 general election Another consequence of the Third Reform Act was the rise of Lib-Lab candidates in the absence of any committed Labour Party The Act split all county constituencies which were represented by multiple MPs in to single-member constituencies roughly corresponding to population pattern In areas with working class majorities in particular coal-mining areas Lib-Lab candidates were popular and they received sponsorship and endorsement from trade unions In the first election after the Act was passed 1885 thirteen were elected up from two in 187 The Third Reform Act also facilitated the demise of the Whig old guard in two-member constituencies it was common to pair a Whig and a radical under the Liberal banne After the Third Reform Act fewer Whigs were selected as candidate The Liberal zenith Herbert Henry Asquith The Liberals languished in opposition for a decade while the coalition of Salisbury and Chamberlain held powe The 1890s were marred by infighting between the three principal successors to Gladstone party leader William Harcourt former Prime Minister Lord Rosebery and Gladstone s personal secretary John Morley This intrigue finally led Harcourt and Morley to resign their positions in 1898 as they continued to be at loggerheads with Rosebery over Irish home rule and issues relating to imperialis Replacing Harcourt as party leader was Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman Harcourt s resignation briefly muted the turmoil in the party but the beginning of the Second Boer War soon nearly broke the party apart with Rosebery and a circle of supporters including important future Liberal leaders H. Asquith Edward Grey and Richard Burdon Haldane forming a clique dubbed the Liberal Imperialists that supported the government in the prosecution of the wa On the other side more radical members of the party formed a Pro-Boer faction that denounced the conflict and called for an immediate end to hostilitie Quickly rising to prominence among the Pro-Boers was David Lloyd George a relatively new MP and a master of rhetoric who took advantage of having a national stage to speak out on a controversial issue to make his name in the part Harcourt and Morley also sided with this group though with slightly different aim Campbell-Bannerman tried to keep these forces together at the head of a moderate Liberal rump but in 1901 he delivered a speech on the government s methods of barbarism in South Africa that pulled him further to the left and nearly tore the party in tw The party was saved after Salisbury s retirement in 1902 when his successor Arthur Balfour pushed a series of unpopular initiatives such as a new education bill and Joseph Chamberlain called for a new system of protectionist tariff Campbell-Bannerman was able to rally the party around the traditional liberal platform of free trade and land reform and led them to the greatest election victory in their histor This would prove the last time the Liberals won a majority in their own righ Although he presided over a large majority Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman was overshadowed by his ministers most notably Herbert Henry Asquith at the Exchequer Edward Grey at the Foreign Office Richard Burdon Haldane at the War Office and David Lloyd George at the Board of Trad An ill Campbell-Bannerman retired in 1908 and died later that yea He was succeeded by Asquith who stepped up the government s radicalis Lloyd George succeeded Asquith at the Exchequer and was in turn succeeded at the Board of Trade by Winston Churchill a recent defector from the Conservative The Liberals pushed through much legislation including the regulation of working hours National Insurance and welfar It was at this time that a political battle over the so-called People s Budget resulted in the passage of an act ending the power of the House of Lords to block legislatio The cost was high however as the government was required by the king to call two general elections in 1910 to validate its position and ended up frittering away most of its large majority being left once again dependent on the Irish Nationalists As a result Asquith was forced to introduce a new third Home Rule bill in 191 Since the House of Lords no longer had the power to block the bill the Unionist s Ulster Volunteers led by Sir Edward Carson launched a campaign of opposition that included the threat of armed resistance in Ulster and the threat of mutiny by army officers in Ireland in 1914 see Curragh Incident In their resistance to Home Rule the Ulster Protestants had the full support of the Conservatives whose leader Andrew Bonar Law was of Ulster-Scots descen The country seemed to be on the brink of civil war when World War I broke out in August 191 The war struck at the heart of everything British Liberals believed i The party became divided over the distinctly illiberal policies that were introduced under her auspices including conscription and the Defence of the Realm Act Several Cabinet ministers resigned and Asquith the master of domestic politics proved a poor war leade Lloyd George and Churchill however were zealous supporters of the war and gradually forced the old pacifist Liberals ou The poor British performance in the early months of the war forced Asquith to invite the Conservatives into a coalition on 17 May 1915 This marked the end of the last all-Liberal governmen This coalition fell apart at the end of 1916 when the Conservatives withdrew their support from Asquith and gave it to Lloyd George instead who became Prime Minister at the head of a coalition government largely made up of Conservative Asquith and his followers moved to the opposition benches in Parliament and the Liberal Party was split once agai Liberal decline David Lloyd George In the 1918 general election Lloyd George the Man Who Won the War led his coalition into another khaki election and won a sweeping victory over the Asquithian Liberals and the newly emerging Labour Party Lloyd George and the Conservative leader Andrew Bonar Law wrote a joint letter of support to candidates to indicate they were considered the official Coalition candidates this coupon as it became known was issued against many sitting Liberal MPs often to devastating effect though not against Asquith himsel Asquith and most of his colleagues lost their seat Lloyd George still claimed to be leading a Liberal government but he was increasingly under the influence of the rejuvenated Conservative part In 1922 the Conservative backbenchers rebelled against the continuation of the coalition citing in particular the Chanak Crisis over Turkey and Lloyd George s corrupt sale of honours amongst other grievances and Lloyd George was forced to resig The Conservatives came back to power under Bonar Law and then Stanley Baldwin At the 1922 and 1923 elections the Liberals won barely a third of the vote and only a quarter of the seats in the House of Commons as many radical voters abandoned the divided Liberals and went over to Labou In 1922 Labour became the official oppositio A reunion of the two warring factions took place in 1923 when the new Conservative Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin committed his party to protective tariffs causing the Liberals to reunite in support of free trad The party gained ground in the 1923 general election but ominously made most of its gains from Conservatives whilst losing ground to Labour a sign of the party s direction for many years to com The party remained the third largest in the House of Commons but the Conservatives had lost their majorit There was much speculation and fear about the prospect of a Labour government and comparatively little about a Liberal government even though it could have plausibly presented an experienced team of ministers compared to Labour s almost complete lack of experience as well as offering a middle ground that could get support from both Conservatives and Labour in crucial Commons division But instead of trying to force the opportunity to form a Liberal government Asquith decided instead to allow Labour the chance of office in the belief that they would prove incompetent and this would set the stage for a revival of Liberal fortunes at Labour s expens It was a fatal erro Share of the vote received by Conservatives blue Whigs/Liberals/Liberal Democrats orange Labour red and others grey in general elections since 183 Following success as the successor to the Whig party the party s share of the popular vote plummeted after the First World War as it lost votes to the new Labour party and fractured into groups such as the National and Coalition Liberal Labour was determined to destroy the Liberals and become the sole party of the lef Ramsay MacDonald was forced into a snap election in 1924 and although his government was defeated he achieved his objective of virtually wiping the Liberals out as many more radical voters now moved to Labour whilst moderate middle-class Liberal voters concerned about socialism moved to the Conservative The Liberals were reduced to a mere forty seats in Parliament only seven of which had been won against candidates from both parties and none of these formed a coherent area of Liberal surviva The party seemed finished and during this period some Liberals such as Churchill went over to the Conservatives while others went over to Labou Several Labour ministers of later generations such as Michael Foot and Tony Benn were the sons of Liberal MP Asquith died in 1928 and the enigmatic figure of Lloyd George returned to the leadership and began a drive to produce coherent policies on many key issues of the da In the 1929 general election he made a final bid to return the Liberals to the political mainstream with an ambitious programme of state stimulation of the economy called We Can Conquer Unemployment! largely written for him by the Liberal economist John Maynard Keynes The Liberals gained ground but once again it was at the Conservatives expense whilst also losing seats to Labou Indeed the urban areas of the country suffering heavily from unemployment which might have been expected to respond the most to the radical economic policies of the Liberals instead gave the party its worst result By contrast most of the party s seats were won either due to the absence of a candidate from one of the other parties or in rural areas on the Celtic fringe where local evidence suggests that economic ideas were at best peripheral to the electorate s concern The Liberals now found themselves with 59 members holding the balance of power in a Parliament where Labour was the largest party but lacked an overall majorit Lloyd George offered a degree of support to the Labour government in the hope of winning concessions including a degree of electoral reform to introduce the alternative vote but this support was to prove bitterly divisive as the Liberals increasingly divided between those seeking to gain what Liberal goals they could achieve those who preferred a Conservative government to a Labour one and vice-vers The last majority Liberal Government in Britain was elected in 190 The pre-World War I period in Britain was a period of worker strikes and civil unrest involving many violent confrontations between the police/troops and civilian Other issues of the period included the suffragettes and the Irish Independence movemen After the carnage of 1914-1918 the democratic reform of the Representation of the People Act 1918 instantly tripled the number of people allowed to vote in Britain from 7 to 21 millio The Labour Party benefited the most from this huge change in the British electorate forming its first minority government in 1924 The splits over the National Government Herbert Samuel In 1931 MacDonald s government fell apart under the Great Depression and the Liberals agreed to join his National Government dominated by the Conservative Lloyd George himself was ill and did not actually joi Soon however the Liberals faced another divisive crisis when a National Government was proposed to fight the 1931 general election with a mandate for tariff From the outside Lloyd George called for the party to abandon the government completely in defence of free trade but only a few MPs and candidates followe Another group under Sir John Simon then emerged who were prepared to continue their support for the government and take the Liberal places in the Cabinet if there were resignation The third group under Sir Herbert Samuel pressed for the parties in government to fight the election on separate platform In doing so the bulk of Liberals remained supporting the government but two distinct Liberal groups had emerged within this bulk the Liberal Nationals officially the National Liberals after 1947 led by Simon also known as Simonites and the Samuelites or official Liberals led by Samuel who remained as the official part Both groups secured about 34 MPs but proceeded to diverge even further after the election with the Liberal Nationals remaining supporters of the government throughout its lif There were to be a succession of discussions about them rejoining the Liberals but these usually foundered on the issues of free trade and continued support for the National Governmen The one significant reunification came in 1946 when the Liberal and Liberal National party organisations in London merge The official Liberals found themselves a tiny minority within a government committed to protectionism Slowly they found this issue to be one they could not suppor In early 1932 it was agreed to suspend the principle of collective responsibility to allow the Liberals to oppose the introduction of tariff Later in 1932 the Liberals resigned their ministerial posts over the introduction of the Ottawa Agreement on Imperial Preference However they remained sitting on the government benches supporting it in Parliament though in the country local Liberal activists bitterly opposed the governmen Finally in late 1933 the Liberals crossed the floor of the House of Commons and went into complete oppositio By this point their number of MPs was severely deplete In the 1935 general election just 17 Liberal MPs were elected along with Lloyd George and three followers as independent Liberals Immediately after the election the two groups reunited though Lloyd George declined to play much of a formal role in his old part Over the next ten years there would be further defections as MPs deserted to either the Liberal Nationals or Labou Yet there were a few recruits such as Clement Davies who had deserted to the National Liberals in 1931 but now returned to the party during the World War II and who would lead it after the wa Near extinction Samuel had lost his seat in the 1935 election and the leadership of the party fell to Sir Archibald Sinclair With many traditional domestic Liberal policies now regarded as irrelevant he focused the party on opposition to both the rise of Fascism in Europe and the appeasement foreign policy of the British government arguing that intervention was needed in contrast to the Labour calls for pacifis Despite the party s weaknesses Sinclair gained a high profile as he sought to recall the Midlothian Campaign and once more revitalise the Liberals as the party of a strong foreign polic In 1940 they joined Churchill s wartime coalition government with Sinclair serving as Secretary of State for Air the last British Liberal to hold Cabinet rank office for seventy year However it was a sign of the party s lack of importance that they were not included in the War Cabinet At the 1945 general election Sinclair and many of his colleagues lost their seats to both Conservatives and Labour and the party returned just 12 MPs to Westminste But this was just the beginning of the declin In 1950 the general election saw the Liberals return just nine MP Another general election was called in 1951 and the Liberals were left with just six MPs in parliament all but one of them were aided by the fact that the Conservatives refrained from fielding candidates in those constituencie In 1957 this total fell to five when one of the Liberal MPs died and the subsequent by-election was lost to the Labour Party which selected the former Liberal Deputy Leader Lady Megan Lloyd George as its own candidat The Liberal Party seemed close to extinctio During this low period it was often joked that Liberal MPs could hold meetings in the back of one tax Liberal revival Through the 1950s and into the 1960s the Liberals survived only because a handful of constituencies in rural Scotland and Wales clung to their Liberal traditions whilst in two English towns Bolton and Huddersfield local Liberals and Conservatives agreed to each contest only one of the town s two seat Jo Grimond for example who became Liberal leader in 1956 was MP for the remote Orkney and Shetland island Under his leadership a Liberal revival began marked by the Orpington by-election of March 1962 which was won by Eric Lubbock There the Liberals won a seat in the London suburbs for the first time since 193 The Liberals became the first of the major British political parties to advocate British membership of the European Economic Community Grimond also sought an intellectual revival of the party seeking to position it as a non-socialist radical alternative to the Conservative government of the da In particular he canvassed the support of the young post-war university students and recent graduates appealing to younger voters in a way that many of his recent predecessors had not and asserting a new strand of Liberalism for the post-war worl The new middle-class suburban generation began to find the Liberals policies attractive agai Under Grimond who retired in 1967 and his successor Jeremy Thorpe the Liberals regained the status of a serious third force in British politics polling up to 20% of the vote but unable to break the duopoly of Labour and Conservative and win more than fourteen seats in the Common An additional problem was competition in the Liberal heartlands in Scotland and Wales from the Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru who both grew as electoral forces from the 1960s onward Although Emlyn Hooson held on to the seat of Montgomeryshire upon Clement Davies death in 1962 the party lost its other Welsh five Welsh seats between 1950 and 196 In September 1966 the Welsh Liberal Party formed their own state party moving the Liberal Party into a fully federal structur In local elections Liverpool remained a Liberal stronghold with the party taking the plurality of seats on the elections to the new Liverpool Metropolitan Borough Council in 197 In the February 1974 general election the Conservative government of Edward Heath won a plurality of votes cast but the Labour Party gained a plurality of seats due to the Ulster Unionist MPs refusing to support the Conservatives after the Northern Ireland Sunningdale Agreement The Liberals now held the balance of power in the Common Conservatives offered Thorpe the Home Office if he would join a coalition government with Heat Thorpe was personally in favour of it but the party insisted on a clear government commitment to introducing proportional representation and a change of Prime Ministe The former was unacceptable to Heath s Cabinet and the latter to Heath personally so the talks collapse Instead a minority Labour government was formed under Harold Wilson but with no formal support from Thorp In the October 1974 general election the Liberals slipped back slightly and the Labour government won a wafer-thin majorit Thorpe was subsequently forced to resign after allegations about his private lif The party s new leader David Steel negotiated the Lib-Lab pact with Wilson s successor as Prime Minister James Callaghan According to this pact the Liberals would support the government in crucial votes in exchange for some influence over polic The agreement lasted from 1977 to 1978 but proved mostly fruitless for two reasons the Liberals key demand of proportional representation was rejected by most Labour MPs whilst the contacts between Liberal spokespersons and Labour ministers often proved detrimental such as between finance spokesperson John Pardoe and Chancellor of the Exchequer Denis Healey who were mutually antagonisti Alliance with Social Democrats When the Labour government fell in 1979 the Conservatives under Margaret Thatcher won a victory which served to push the Liberals back into the margin In 1981 defectors from the moderate wing of the Labour Party led by former Cabinet ministers Roy Jenkins David Owen and Shirley Williams founded the Social Democratic Party The new party and the Liberals quickly formed an alliance which briefly topped the opinion polls before being overtaken by the Tories and fought the 1983 and 1987 general elections jointly as the SDPLiberal Alliance During 1982 and 1983 at the depths of Labour s fortunes under Michael Foot there was much talk of the Alliance becoming the dominant party of the left and even of Jenkins becoming Prime Ministe In fact while the Alliance won over 20% of the vote each time it was still a long way behind Labour in terms of seats and as a result was disbanded after the 1987 election with the two parties merging the following year to form the Social and Liberal Democrats who a year after that become the Liberal Democrat Merger with Social Democrats Main article Liberal Democrats UK In 1988 the Liberals and Social Democrats merged to create what came to be called the Liberal Democrats Over two-thirds of the members and all the serving MPs of the Liberal Party joined this party led first jointly by Steel and the SDP leader Robert Maclennan and later by Paddy Ashdown 198899 Charles Kennedy 19992006 Sir Menzies Campbell 200607 and Nick Clegg incumbent Though the merger process was traumatic and the new party suffered a few years of extremely poor poll results it gradually found much greater electoral success than the Liberal Party had done in the post-war er In the 2005 general election the Liberal Democrats elected 62 MPs to the House of Commons a far cry from the days when the Liberals had just 5 MPs and Liberalism as a political force had seemed moribun As was the case with the Liberal Party for most of the 20th century the Liberal Democrats face constant questioning about which of the other two parties they are closer to in particular about which they would support in the event of a hung parliament The party is keen to maintain its independent identity however and argues that the need for a modern Liberal force in British politics has never been greate In the 2010 General Election the Conservative Party won more seats than any other but not enough to form a majority governmen After several days of negotiation the Liberal Democrats agreed to join the Conservatives as part of a coalition governmen The post-1988 Liberal Party Main article Liberal Party UK 1989 A group of Liberal opponents of the merger with the Social Democrats including Michael Meadowcroft formerly Liberal MP for Leeds West and Paul Wiggin who served on Peterborough City Council as a Liberal continued under the old name of the Liberal Party This was legally a new organisation the headquarters records assets and debts of the old party were inherited by the Liberal Democrats but its constitution asserts it to be the same Liberal part The party retains minor influence in some local council Meadowcroft himself eventually joined the
